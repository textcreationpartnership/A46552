            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE weight of this illu≈øtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Subject might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a greater <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ndertaker, and made me have kept at an awfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, whil≈øt the mo≈øt celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Pens of <hi>Europe</hi> had interwoven and enamell'd the Birth and Ri≈øing, Glories of ≈øo great a Prince, with all the Rhetorical and Heroick Accents and Expre≈ø≈øions that are capable of giving Life and Fire to the Minds of Men, and rai≈øing their Souls to a highth capable of knowing the Centre of true Greatne≈øs; but with humble ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, not finding any forward in ≈øo invaluable an Enterprize, I, though unworthy, have pre≈øumed to
<pb facs="tcp:56844:4"/>make this E≈ø≈øay, hoping it will not be taken ill, ≈øince this, at lea≈øt, is the Ground-work, upon which the mo≈øt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpiring Hi≈øtorian mu≈øt build, when he con≈øults the Golden Rolls of Fame to rai≈øe a Pyramid of la≈øting Honour to the Memories of the World's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Worthies. In this Book, though ≈ømall to appearance, you may find things as va≈øt in Extent as Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Valour can enlarge them; and when I tell you it is the Compendium of the Birth and Actions of the Great and Renowned Prince of the Hou≈øe of <hi>Orange,</hi> with what more e≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relates to his Redeeming us from Popery and Slavery, by his generous Expedition, Valour, and Conduct, I might be ≈øilent, ≈øince the World is ≈øufficiently ≈øen≈øible of what I farther intend; yet that Po≈øterity may not forget ≈øo great a Deliverance, it is fit that it ≈øhould be Recorded till Time is ≈øwallowed up in Eternity.</p>
            <p>You have, Reader, in this Book an
<pb facs="tcp:56844:4"/>Account of the illu≈øtrious Birth of a Prince, born to be the Protectour of the true Religion, and the Support (next the Almighty Arm) of Chri≈øtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, coming neare≈øt to its primitive Purity, with his Advancement to early Honours, and his memorable Actions from time to time, with the various dangers and hazards to which he has expo≈øed him≈øelf, for the Repo≈øe of <hi>Chri≈øtendom,</hi> but more e≈øpecially for the ≈øecuring and promoting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtant Religion. You have likewi≈øe a Di≈øcovery of Popi≈øh Cruelties, in the wretched State and Condition of the Prote≈øtants in <hi>France,</hi> under the late Per≈øecution, from which you may gather what we might have expected and ≈øuffered, had not this great Prince at ≈øo much Co≈øt, hazard of his Per≈øon, and indefatigable Labour and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtry, di≈øpell'd with the Rays of his early and glorious Succe≈øs, the cloudy Tempest that was breaking over our Heads; and to be brief, you have an
<pb facs="tcp:56844:5"/>Account of all that has memorably pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed from his Birth to this day, and that more particularly in <hi>England,</hi> upon the ever-to-be-remembered Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of his coming over as our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour and Deliverer, with the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable Indu≈øtry he has ≈øucce≈øsfully u≈øed to infatuate and defeat the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns of our Enemies, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns he has found from a ≈øen≈øible and gratefull People, and e≈øpecially the Wi≈ødom of the Nation A≈ø≈øembled in Parliament, in Proclaiming and Crowning him, together with his Royal Con≈øort, King and Queen of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. with the manner of the performance, and what el≈øe can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to ≈øet forth ≈øo illu≈øtrious an History, the Subject of which may ≈øome Angel ≈øound with a golden Trumpet to the utmo≈øt Kingdoms of the Earth: which is the Wi≈øh of</p>

            <p>
               <hi>WIlliam Henry,</hi> of the Illu≈øtrious Hou≈øe of <hi>Na≈ø≈øau,</hi> our pre≈øent Sovereign, de≈øcended from that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>German</hi> Family, that has been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Famous, and to which the <hi>Empire</hi> and all <hi>Chri≈øtendom</hi> has been ≈øo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden, Son to <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Na≈ø≈øau,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> by the Royal Prince≈øs <hi>Mary,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Charles</hi> I. King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c. was Born on the 14th. of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> in the year of our Lord, 1650. his Father dying the preceding Month, after he had been Married about nine Years, and done Actions worthy of his high Birth, in the Four and Twentieth year of his Age, leaving this hopefull, I≈ø≈øue to di≈øpell the Clouds of Sorrow that began to ≈øpread them≈øelves over mo≈øt <hi>European</hi> Courts, upon notice of a Death ≈øo unexpected, and a Lo≈øs ≈øo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant.</p>
            <p>This great Prince at his Bapti≈øm had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56844:6"/>for Godfathers the Lords <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> and the Cities of <hi>Am≈øterdam, Delf,</hi> and <hi>Leyden,</hi> receiving the Name of <hi>William Henry;</hi> and as he increa≈øed in years, under the Care of the indulgent Prince≈øs, and ≈øuch as were appointed to attend and wait upon him, he gave early hope of what hath ≈øince been ≈øufficiently manife≈øted.</p>
            <p>At five years of Age he came to vi≈øit his Uncle, King <hi>Charles</hi> II who then was at <hi>Breda,</hi> preparing for <hi>England,</hi> to take Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Thrones and Kingdoms, ≈øo long detained from him; where the King expre≈ø≈øed his extraordinary ≈øatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ≈øee the Prince his Nephew, and highly welcomed him; and ≈øoon after the <hi>E≈øtates General,</hi> having a particular Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the King, recommending the firmne≈øs and fidelity of that Republick to his Intere≈øt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his Maje≈øty in the mo≈øt obliging Terms replyed, <hi>That the Intere≈øt, if no other Motives ≈øhould induce him to it, of two Per≈øons ≈øo nearly allied to him, as the Prince≈øs Royal his Si≈øter, and the Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>his Nephew, who live in the E≈øtate as part of it, mu≈øt unavoidably endear it to him.</hi> However, there were many Rea≈øons of State, which obliged him to make with tho≈øe Provinces a mo≈øt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56844:7"/>≈øtrict Alliance: And now the King's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture for <hi>England</hi> being at hand, the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtates General</hi> named Mr. <hi>De Gent.</hi> Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Guelderland, Guelderwagen</hi> of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Lamp≈øins</hi> of <hi>Zeland,</hi> to wait upon the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who was then with the King, and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Gloucester,</hi> who Lodged in the Extroardinary Amba≈ø≈øador's Hou≈øe, to complement them on the Re-e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King, and the Revolution of the Affairs of <hi>England;</hi> and at the ≈øame time Mr. <hi>Ren≈øwonde</hi> of <hi>Utreicht, Ripperdo</hi> of <hi>Hengelo,</hi> of <hi>Overy≈øel,</hi> together with <hi>Isbrants</hi> of <hi>Groning,</hi> were deputed to the ≈øame Office, by the Prince≈øs Royal, and the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King being treated by the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtates General</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> he ≈øitting at the middle of the Table-head, had on the Right Hand the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> on the Left the Prince≈øs Royal, and there the Prince was pre≈øent, a Seat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed on purpo≈øe for him to di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh his Character, though in his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der years, from Lords of great Rank and Quality, who were pre≈øent at that ≈øplendid Entertainment; and this order was ob≈øerved whenever he Dined pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly with the King, which he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>The <hi>De Wits</hi> falling thus from their highth of Honour, <hi>Min Heer Fagel</hi> was made Pentionary with the Prince's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; and indeed de≈øervedly, having been the fir≈øt, when only Pentioner of <hi>Haerlem,</hi> to open peoples Eyes upon the inevitable Ruine that mu≈øt have atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the continuance of the <hi>De Wits</hi> Mini≈øtry, and thereupon the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> wrote a mo≈øt obliging Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56844:10"/>Fight, and many kill'd on both ≈øides, he put a ≈øuccour of 300 Men into it, and with con≈øiderable Lo≈øs retreated.

            <p>After the≈øe Proceedings, his Highne≈øs held a Council of War, and having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven nece≈ø≈øary Orders, marched to <hi>Ro≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> where the General Rendezvouz were appointed, and there having mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtered an Army to the number of 24000. he took his March towards the Country of <hi>Liege,</hi> and obliged the Count <hi>de Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> to retire to <hi>Sta≈ø≈øemburgh</hi> with the Army he then had under his Command, being de≈øirous, if it might conveniently be, to give him Battel: but under≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the Count frequently ≈øhifted his Quarters, in a kind of a retiring man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Prince after inve≈øting <hi>Tongeren</hi> with his own and ≈øuch Spani≈øh Forces as

            <p>During the≈øe Tran≈øactions, the French in con≈øiderable Parties taking the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the hard Fro≈øt, marched over the Ice, and made ≈øome incon≈øiderable ≈øpoil in the Villages, but upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of his Highne≈øs they retired in di≈øorder, with con≈øiderable lo≈øs; and had the Pa≈ø≈øes been defended as the <hi>States</hi> directed, mo≈øt of them had peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed in the Waters, by rea≈øon of the ≈øudden Thaw that en≈øued.

            <p>The Spring advancing, the French King made great preparations again≈øt <hi>Holland,</hi> invading them in Per≈øon with a powerfull Army, whil≈øt the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped at <hi>Utriecht,</hi> expecting Orders to fall into the County.

            <p>The≈øe were the principal Tran≈øacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the end of the year 1673. and in gratitude for the Services his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs had done the <hi>States</hi> by his Valour and Conduct, in freeing them from the Danger of their capital Enemies, and recovering ≈øo many wealthy Towns, they confirmed to him the Dignity of Stateholder, for the Provinces of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>We≈øt Friezeland,</hi> pa≈ø≈øing a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to hold it not only for his Life, but to ≈øettle it upon the Heirs Male of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in lawfull Marriage, for ever.

            <p>The Fight being over, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates with a ≈øtrong Party keeping the Field all Night, the Prince the next day marched by <hi>Mons</hi> with his whole Army, and was recruited at St. <hi>Gilain</hi> with five Dutch Regiments, and there he Quartered, whil≈øt the Imperiali≈øts march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Queverain;</hi> when ≈øoon after Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Rabenhaupt</hi> laid Siege to the <hi>Greves,</hi> a ≈øtrong Gari≈øon po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed by the French, and as ≈øtoutly defended, in≈øomuch that he had been undoubtedly obliged to quit that Siege, had not the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> perfected it by the a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtence he gave; for the Gari≈øon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øted of 4000 Foot, and 9 Troups of Hor≈øe, and in it 450 pieces of Cannon, a hundred of them mounted, be≈øides a large ≈øtore of Ammunition and Provi≈øion,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56844:16"/>yet this ≈øtrong place yielded to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable Fortune of the Prince; for finding the Imperiali≈øts and <hi>Spaniards</hi> not forward to hazard a ≈øecond Battel with <hi>Conde,</hi> who was by this time con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly re-inforced, leaving the Gro≈øs of his Army with Prince <hi>Waldeck,</hi> he came to the Siege of this place with 60 Troups of Hor≈øe, which ≈øo animated the Be≈øie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and daunted the Be≈øieged, that the Marque≈øs <hi>De Chamilly,</hi> Governour of the Town, finding the great Breaches that were made in the Walls, and the mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief done by the ≈øpringing of the Mines, he began to conclude it could not hold out a re≈øolute A≈ø≈øault, and ≈øo coming to a Parley, obtained honourable Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; by which means the Curb that this ≈øtrong Gari≈øon had put upon the nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries was happily taken off, and the Troups for the mo≈øt part were put into Winter Quarters, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Action happened till the en≈øuing Spring; yet in con≈øideration of the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Services the Prince had done the <hi>States,</hi> they of <hi>Guelderland</hi> offered him as an addition to his other Honours, the Sovereignty of the Dutchy of <hi>Guelders,</hi> &amp; the County of <hi>Zutphen;</hi> and though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provinces intimated at the ≈øame time

            <p>I ≈øhall not trouble you with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration put out again≈øt the Prote≈øtants in the year 1669. or hard≈øhips they ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered before and ≈øince that year in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, till I come to the year 1680. In this year the King i≈ø≈øued out his Order, thereby depriving them in general of all manner of places of Tru≈øt, Offices, and Services; reducing the meaner ≈øort thereby to great di≈øtre≈øs, and di≈øanulling the more wealthy of what they had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øed with their Money, and the price of their Bloud: And the next year 1681,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56844:33"/>by a Decree of their Council, all Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Attornies, Solicitors, and Sergeants, which made profe≈ø≈øion of the Reformed Religion, were rendred uncapable of their Employments; and the next year the Lords and Gentlemen were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to di≈øcharge their Prote≈øtant Officers and Servants; and in Eighty three, all Officers of the King's Hou≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and tho≈øe of the Princes of the Bloud, were commanded to give place to the Roman Catholicks; and in a word, all manner of Per≈øons of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øions, that were of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, had a Prohibition by tho≈øe ≈øtrict Decrees under ≈øevere Penalties: And ≈øo ≈øtrict were they, that the Midwives, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs Roman Catholicks, dur≈øt not, but by ≈øtealth, perform their Office, and by this means, ≈øome were con≈øtrained to ≈øuffer their Tongue to give their Heart the Lye. The≈øe, for the encouragement as they pretended of them≈øelves and others, being called new Converts, were di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the Payment of their Debts for the ≈øpace of three years, and this was done the better to di≈øappoint their Creditors of the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with whom they had mo≈øtly dealt: Nor content with this, by another way
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56844:34"/>they quite di≈øcharged them of ≈øuch Debts as tho≈øe of that Religion had contracted in common.</p>
            <p>The≈øe Proceedings ≈øerved only as a Prologue to that which was afterward acted on the Unchri≈øtian-like Stage of <hi>France;</hi> for the Councils, influenced by the Prie≈øts, who aimed more at the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtates of the Prote≈øtants than their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, finding the≈øe ways not ≈øo effectual as they expected; and perceiving that many of the more wealthy made over their E≈øtates, and left the Country, exhibited a Prohibition of ≈øelling, or alienating any E≈øtates what≈øoever, the King annulling and breaking all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and other Acts, relating to ≈øuch Sale or Alienation, if it did not appear that after any ≈øuch Act they did not ≈øtay in the Kingdom a whole year; ≈øo that being deprived of all means to tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their effects, and yet not ≈øuffered to enjoy them with any quiet, many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring a good Con≈øcience before world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Riches, propo≈øed to leave all they had, and with it the Kingdom; but this took no effect; for hereupon they were forbidden it under ≈øevere Penalties, which drove them to ≈øo great a ≈øtrait, that they knew not what offer or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øal
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56844:34"/>to make, finding every thing hazardous and uncertain: But they were not long without new Proofs of Roman Severity; for though they had already fleeced them, yet not ≈øo contented, the Intendents in their Di≈øtricts had orders to weigh them down, if po≈ø≈øible, with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Taxes, by charging them with tho≈øe of the new Converts, who were di≈øchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from paying any, in favour of their pretended Conver≈øion, or by laying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on them, which they termed Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ≈øo that he who was before a≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed in the Roll for 40 or 50 Livres, e≈øcaped well, if he came off for 5 or 600, and tho≈øe that delayed, or had not the Money, were obliged to quarter Dragoons, and ≈øuffer Impri≈øonment till they had made payment. And to pa≈øs over many things of the like Nature, though the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtants neglected nothing, either by way of Supplication, or endeavouring to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtifie their Rights, and manife≈øt the wrong done them before the Judges in the re≈øpective Provinces; it was but like Water thrown upon lce, the more to harden it: But the Prie≈øts fearing this manner of Submi≈ø≈øion might mollifie the King, who is not over much given to relent, they u≈øed all their Intere≈øts to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56844:35"/>pu≈øh him on to a violenter motion; ≈øo that the Papi≈øts gave out, he was re≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to ≈øuffer any <hi>Hugonots</hi> (≈øo they called the Prote≈øtants) to live in the Kingdom; nor, like <hi>Pharoah,</hi> would he ≈øuffer them at the ≈øame time to depart.</p>
            <p>The Project by this time being grown ripe for Cruelty, they began with <hi>Bearn,</hi> where the Dragoons, committed their fir≈øt Ravages, and after that, in High and Low <hi>Guinne, Xantoigne, Poictou,</hi> High <hi>Languedock Vivarets,</hi> and <hi>Dauphin,</hi> with ≈øome other places in tho≈øe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and after that in <hi>Lionois,</hi> Low <hi>Languedock, Gevennes, Valees, Provence,</hi> and the Countries of <hi>Geix,</hi> and then in <hi>Normandy, Bougoigne, Nivernois, Berry,</hi> and the Countries of <hi>Orleance, Tourain, Anjou, Bretaign, Champaign, Piccardy,</hi> the I≈øles of <hi>France,</hi> and even in <hi>Paris</hi> it ≈øelf, and in all Parts where any of the Reformed Religion had Habitations, or were fled for ≈øhelter; and the fir≈øt thing the Intendents were ordered to doe, was to Summon the Cities and Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who were to a≈ø≈øemble the Inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the re≈øpective Places, profe≈ø≈øing the Prote≈øtant Religion, and let them know it was the King's Plea≈øure they ≈øhould turn Roman Catholicks, or they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56844:35"/>≈øhould be forc'd to doe it; at which the poor people greatly ≈øurprized, in an humble manner replyed, They were ready to ≈øacrifice their Lives and E≈øtates to the Service of the King, but their Con≈øciences being Gods' alone, they could not in that manner di≈øpo≈øe of them.</p>
            <p>Upon Refu≈øal, the Dragoons who were at hand, were immediately ≈øent for, who in a furious manner ≈øeizing the Gates and Avenues of the Cities and Villages, guarding the Pa≈ø≈øes that none might e≈øcape, they often came with their Swords in their hands, crying <hi>Kill, kill, or el≈øe be Catholicks;</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they came, like the Locu≈øt, they devoured every good thing, being Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon the Prote≈øtants at di≈øcretion, with a Charge not to ≈øuffer them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of their Hou≈øes, or conceal any of their Goods, under great Penalties to the Papi≈øts that ≈øhould receive or comfort them; and having eaten up their Provi≈øions, and plundred all that was of value, which they ≈øold to the nighbouring Catholicks, they in an inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane manner fell upon their Per≈øons: And now prepare to hear what even the Turks may blu≈øh to own.</p>

            <p>After many Revilings, Cur≈øes, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations, they proceeded to hang up Men and Women by the Hair, or Feet, on the Roofs of Chambers or Chimney holes, where putting Wi≈øps of wet Hay on the Fire under them, they ≈ømoaked them till they were almo≈øt ≈øuffocated; and when they had taken them down, if they would not ≈øign to an Abjuration they hung them up again, or to≈ø≈øed them to and fro into great Fires till they were in a manner roa≈øted: Under the Arms of ≈øome they tied Ropes, and plunged them in Wells till they were half drowned, ≈øwearing to fini≈øh their Lives there, unle≈øs they would promi≈øe to change their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Others they bound like Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, when putting to them the Que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they placed Funnels in their Mouths, and pouted Wine down their Throats, till having deprived them of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, they obliged them to ≈øay they would be Catholicks: Some again they ≈øtripp'd naked, and pricked with Pins and Bodkins, till they were no longer able to endure it: Others they led about by the No≈øes with Pincers, and wounded them with Pen knives: They beat ≈øome with Staves and dragged them, after much cruel u≈øage, to the Churches,

The Eleventh confirms a former Declaration to puni≈øh tho≈øe that Relap≈øe.

            <p>The very day this Edict was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed, ≈øo ha≈øty were the≈øe Dragoon. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters, that they began to demoli≈øh the famous Church of <hi>Chreenton,</hi> the elder Mini≈øter belonging to it being comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to leave <hi>Paris</hi> within Twenty four hours, and with all convenient ≈øpeed depart the Kingdom; and thereupon he was committed to the Charge of one of the King's Foot men, with an expre≈øs Order not to part with him till he was out of the Confines of <hi>France;</hi> but his Colleagues had Forty eight hours given
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56844:40"/>them to leave the City, and were per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted to depart upon their Parole; and the re≈øt had the time limited, but with ≈øo many vexations, that none but Men of great firmne≈øs of mind could have born it; for they not only denied them all their Movables and Books, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their private Papers, under pretence that they knew not whether they were theirs, or belonged to the Con≈øi≈øtory; but what was more cruel, they refu≈øed their Fathers or Mothers, Brothers or Si≈øters, or any of their near Relations to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them, though many of them were aged and infirm, and mu≈øt, unle≈øs ≈øupported by an extraordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, peri≈øh, without their ≈øuccour and a≈ø≈øi≈øtence: nor was this all, for they kept from them their Children above the Age of ≈øeven, and ≈øome, where they had a more peculiar ≈øpight again≈øt the Father, that were ≈øcarcely weaned; nor would they allow a Nur≈øe to the ≈øucking Children where the Mother's Milk was dried up, and ≈øhe incapable of giving them ≈øu≈øtenance of that kind; and although they had Pa≈øports, yet were they ≈øtopped upon the Borders, in divers places, by the malice of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts, under pretence they mu≈øt pre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56844:40"/>prove they were the ≈øame Per≈øons mentioned, and that there was no cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Proce≈øs, or Information charged again≈øt them, and ju≈øtifie that they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away nothing belonging to their Congregations; and this they did upon no other pretence than to en≈ønare them by ≈øpinning out the limited time for their Departure; for the days being expired, though they them≈øelves were the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers, in plain terms they told them their time was relap≈øed, and there was no hopes of e≈øcaping the Galleys.</p>
            <p>But now the Ports, Ways, and Fords, and all Places throughout the Kingdom, were ≈øo ≈øtrictly guarded, and narrowly ≈øearched by the Officers of the Forts and Cu≈øtoms, Soldiers and Pea≈øants, that mo≈øt of tho≈øe that endeavoured to e≈øcape, were ≈øeized, and hurried to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, whereby the Gaols became thron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and crouded; nor had they the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of common Malefactours, but were thru≈øt into Dungeons, and noi≈øome places, their Friends not daring to vi≈øit or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, by which means a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber peri≈øhed through hunger, and other inconveniencies; and although the Twelfth Article promi≈øes to ≈øecure the Laity in their Properties, Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56844:41"/>and Callings, yet the French Papi≈øts have not forgot the Decree of <hi>Con≈øtance,</hi> wherein it is expre≈ø≈øed, <hi>That no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks,</hi> as they call the Prote≈øtants, for the ≈øame cruelty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity continued with as great Rage and Fury, where there was any plunder to be had, or people of Note dwelling: In <hi>Picardy, Normandy, Le Berry, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne, Orleance, Neivernois, Bele≈ø≈øois,</hi> and the I≈øles of <hi>France,</hi> nay, in <hi>Paris</hi> it ≈øelf, after the Edict was publi≈øhed, the Procurator-General, and ≈øome other Magi≈øtrates, ≈øent for the Heads of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Families, and declared to them, That it was the King's po≈øitive Will that they ≈øhould change their Religion, and that if they would not comply they ≈øhould be made to doe it; and ≈øo procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Letters under the Princes Seal, to bani≈øh the Elders of the Con≈øi≈øtory, and ≈øuch per≈øons as they found, or at lea≈øt conceived inflexible.</p>
            <p>One thing is remarkable, <hi>viz. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur Saignelay,</hi> Secretary of State, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ≈øent for to his Hou≈øe, under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers pretences; about 100 Merchants, and others, he cau≈øed the Doors to be ≈øhut upon them, and in≈øtead of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs they expected, pre≈øented them
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56844:41"/>with an Abjuration, commanding them in the King's name to ≈øign it, declaring with a ≈øtern Countenance, they ≈øhould not ≈øtir out at the Door till they had done it: The purport of it was this, That they ≈øhould not only abjure the Here≈øie of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and enter into the Catholick Church, but declare that they did it voluntarily, or without being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or compelled to it; and although they many ways excu≈øed it, yet being ≈øharply reprimanded, and terrified by his Threats, not being fore-warned of ≈øuch a danger, and doubting the ill con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that might attend it, they at la≈øt, not voluntarily, but by con≈øtraint, ≈øigned that Abjuration: Nor by the power and influence of the Clergy, did the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrates refrain to take away Children from their Parents, to bring up in their ≈øuper≈øtitious way of idolatrous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, frequently ≈øeparating the Man and Wife, where they could gain upon the one, or the other, to Apo≈øtatize. Nor did they ≈øpare to doe this in <hi>Orange,</hi> the ≈øovereign Principality of his Highne≈øs the Prince, where the French King, by Right, has no power, but taking away the Mini≈øters by force, committed them to Pri≈øon; the Dragoons, as it has been already hinted, doing there mi≈øchiefs
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56844:42"/>much in likene≈øs as in other Places, as well to the people as to the Officers of his Highne≈øs, to whom that Principality belongs. And much in this nature the Calamity of the ≈øuffering Prote≈øtants continued in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> to the year 1685. Nor do they fail at this day to make good, as much as in them lies, what their Clergy threaten in their Pa≈øtoral Letters, by making it their ≈øtudy to invent new manner of Torments, the Magi≈øtrates being ever ready to a≈ø≈øi≈øt them in the Execution.</p>
            <p>I might go on with this melancholy Story to the ≈øwelling of a large Volume, and add to it the Cruelty of the Savoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards again≈øt the Prote≈øtants in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries under that Duke, who≈øe Mi≈øeries equal, if not exceed, that I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; as likewi≈øe in ≈øundry other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and indeed in all places where the Papi≈øts have power, but that the digre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion will ≈øeem too long; and therefore I only give the Reader a ta≈øte of what has been ≈øerved up in full Banquets of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Revenge, thereby to let tho≈øe that are at this day un-informed, know what they mu≈øt expect, if they come into the hands of ≈øuch as account it merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to de≈øtroy Hereticks, nor think it any Crime to break the mo≈øt ≈øolemn
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56844:42"/>Oaths, and make void all Prote≈øtations and Engagements, when they ≈øuppo≈øe it advantageous to their Intere≈øt, or Church's Cau≈øe: And note by the way, that all of the Reformed Religion, who have ≈øeparated from the Traditions, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and Idolatrous Wor≈øhip of <hi>Rome,</hi> pa≈øs with them for no other. The≈øe Proceedings however turned at la≈øt to the di≈øadvantage of the Per≈øecutors; for, though for a time it enriched them, yet the number of People that fled, or were ruined, occa≈øioned the decay of Trade and Commerce, ≈øo that tho≈øe Revenues that ≈øupplied the French King's Coffers, and enabled him to vex all <hi>Europe,</hi> by a tedious War being exhau≈øted, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding he had taken <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> from the Spaniards, he found him≈øelf in a low condition; for money being the very ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of War, and his Subjects not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to lend, as appears by the An≈øwer of the Bankers of <hi>Paris,</hi> when he ≈øent to them the la≈øt year for ≈øeveral Millions of Livres, <hi>viz</hi> That they humbly beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Excu≈øe, fora≈ømuch that if they ≈øo far weakened the Bank, they could not ≈øupport their Credit in an≈øwering the Bills that ≈øhould be drawn upon them; He then, I ≈øay, found that when
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56844:43"/>by ≈øuch unju≈øt means he depopulated his Kingdom, he fought again≈øt him≈øelf: but to return.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> all this while highly di≈øapproved his Proceedings, and if in Arms he did not oppo≈øe them, it was not for want of Will; but rather that he on his part would keep the Peace inviolable, and rather bear, till a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opportunity, the affront and injury done him, in the wrong his Subjects of the Principality of <hi>Orange</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, than involve the States in a new War; which might have been ju≈øtly excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, ≈øince the French were the Aggre≈ø≈øors. But to come yet nearer to the purpo≈øe:</p>
            <p>Whil≈øt his Highne≈øs was diverting and repo≈øing him≈øelf from the Toils of War, which now cea≈øed by the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion and ratifying of the Treaty with <hi>France,</hi> His Maje≈øty of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> II. after five or ≈øix days indi≈øpo≈øition, departed this Life at his Palace Royal of <hi>White-Hall</hi> on the 6th. of <hi>February,</hi> 1684. not only to the extraordinary Grief of his Subjects, but of all <hi>Europe,</hi> their Highne≈ø≈øes more e≈øpecially bearing a ≈øuperlative part in the ≈øorrow the lo≈øs of that good King occa≈øioned, who≈øe Funeral was private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56844:43"/>≈øolemnized on the 14th. of <hi>February</hi> towards the Evening in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's Chapell, where it was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Vault under the Ea≈øt-end of the South-I≈øle; Service being ended, and the Officers of his Hou≈øhold having broke their Staves, the Royal Style was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by another of the Kings at Arms, according to the Cu≈øtome: And thus ≈øet this great Monarch, who had been ≈øo u≈øefull and dear to the Intere≈øt of <hi>Chri≈øtendom,</hi> making way thereby for his Brother, who was immediately proclaimed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and accordingly was Crowned at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> on the twenty third of <hi>April</hi> following, with much ≈øplendour and magnificence, as is u≈øual at the Royal Ceremonies of the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> &amp;c. and had the Condolement and Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, the one for the Death of King <hi>Charles,</hi> and the other for His Maje≈øty's Acce≈ø≈øion to the Throne, not only from the States-General, but from mo≈øt of the European Princes. And now the States of <hi>Holland</hi> being in frequent Con≈øults about the Affairs of that Republick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Adjournments his Highne≈øs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> diverted him≈øelf in vi≈øiting the Towns and Fortifications,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56844:44"/>and ≈øettling Military Affairs; and the better to remove the Melancholy the Death of the King his Uncle had occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, recreated him≈øelf at his Country Palace; when in the mean while the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> going from <hi>Holland</hi> with an incon≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of Men, the former to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>England,</hi> and the latter <hi>Scotland,</hi> their Expeditions proved altogether ≈øucce≈øsle≈øs for being ≈øeverally routed, and taken by the King's Forces, they ≈øuffered Death, together with divers others of their Adherents and Abettors.</p>
            <p>In <hi>July,</hi> 1687. his Highne≈øs returning from <hi>Houn≈øtyrdyke</hi> to the <hi>Hague,</hi> he there gave Audience to ≈øeveral foreign Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters, and then parted thence to vi≈øit the Gari≈øons of <hi>Mae≈øtricht, Boi≈øleduck,</hi> and others belonging to the States, and in his Return was met by Her Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs at <hi>Loo,</hi> he having in his Progre≈øs gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven nece≈ø≈øary Orders for the well gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ≈øtrengthening of tho≈øe Places:</p>
            <p>In <hi>December</hi> the <hi>Marque≈øs d' Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> Envoy extraordinary from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> had Audience of his Highne≈øs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> but they adjour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the 7th. of <hi>January,</hi> great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations

Now the foreign Prie≈øts coming again into remembrance, and being looked upon as Enemies to the Common-wealth, notwith≈øtanding the interce≈ø≈øion that had been made on their behalf, the Court of Ju≈øtice at the <hi>Hague</hi> drew up a Decree, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to retire out of the Country, and never to return again, promi≈øing a Reward of 100 Ducatoons to any that ≈øhould make di≈øcovery, and ≈øettling a penalty of 600 Florins upon tho≈øe that ≈øhould harbour and conceal any of them, for the fir≈øt time; 1200 for the ≈øecond; and corporal puni≈øhment for the third Offence; whereupon a great many of them fled into <hi>England,</hi> where indeed there was but too many before: And now the Spring coming on, the Prince and Prince≈øs of <hi>Orange</hi> went to their Palace at <hi>Loo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England,</hi> for private Rea≈øons of State, being about this time de≈øirous to call home the Engli≈øh Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56844:45"/>in the Service of the States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the <hi>Marque≈øs d' Albeville</hi> made it known immediately to their Lord≈øhips, but they not willing to part with tho≈øe Forces, he proceeded to put in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials, repre≈øenting not only his Re≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Refu≈øal, but the danger of Officers and Soldiers might incurr; but the States having before-hand di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded them, and li≈øted them under their own Command, as many as would enter them≈øelves, (which was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt Part of them, as well Officers as Soldiers,) this bu≈øine≈øs came to nothing; and although his Maje≈øty had ordered the Ma≈øters and Captains of Ships and Ve≈ø≈øels, to give ≈øuch as would return free Pa≈ø≈øage, with promi≈øe of Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet not many came over.</p>
            <p>In <hi>May</hi> the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> was ≈øplendidly entertained by his Highne≈øs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> at <hi>Houn≈ølaerdyke,</hi> and the next day his Highne≈øs accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him to <hi>Scheveling,</hi> where they went on Board a ≈ømall Ve≈ø≈øel that carried them to a Squadron of 17 Men of War, arrived from <hi>Schonevelt,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Vice-Admiral <hi>Allemond,</hi> who ≈øent upon their Approach two light Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, and a Shallop, to meet them,

            <p>About 1500 Hor≈øe, and 3 Troups of Iri≈øh Dragoons being quartered, or po≈øted in the Town of <hi>Reading,</hi> were put into a Con≈øternation upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that a ≈øtrong advanced Party of the Prince's Army were on their march to beat up their Quarters; ≈øo that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øome Con≈øultation of the Officers, it was concluded they ≈øhould draw off to <hi>Twyford</hi>-Bridge, and there make good their Po≈øt, which accordingly they did; but the Scouts that were ≈øent abroad to di≈øcover, coming in, and giving them an account that the Roads were clear, the Commander in chief commanded that <hi>Claverhou≈øe</hi> Regiment of Scotch Hor≈øe, and the Iri≈øh Dragoons, ≈øhould march back, and repo≈ø≈øe≈øs the Town of <hi>Reading,</hi> which they did on the Eighth of <hi>December</hi> at Night, with Orders to be in readine≈øs, and upon their Guards

            <p>The Queen having left <hi>White-Hall,</hi> as al≈øo a great many of the Courtiers, the King the ≈øame Evening called an extraordinary Council; and ≈øent for the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and the Sheriffs; who waiting upon His Maje≈øty, were, among≈øt other things, charged to have a Care of the City, and keep it in Peace and Quietne≈øs, as much as in them lay, and then were di≈ømi≈ø≈øed: However, the Council held a long De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and a meeting was appointed the, the next Morning; but, contrary to the Expectation of almo≈øt the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the King, about Three a Clock in the Night, took Barge at the <hi>Privy Stairs,</hi> with a ≈ømall Equipage; and went down the River on his Departure, without giving notice to any of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his Hou≈øhold, who were then in</p>

            <p>This Order cau≈øed the Troups to fall off and disband, as well becau≈øe they knew them≈øelves without a Head, as not knowing how to come by their Pay, if they continued in the Service; and indeed many of the Foot Soldiers were driven to great extremity; being by this Disbanding de≈øtitute of Moneys, Lodging, and other necce≈ø≈øaries, and had for a while nothing to ≈øub≈øi≈øt, but the Charity of the People: And although the Iri≈øh Battalion ≈øeemed for a time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinate to continue in Arms, yet the Commands they received from His Highne≈øs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the nece≈ø≈øity that they felt, con≈øtrained them to ≈øubmit.</p>
            <p>This Di≈øper≈øing of the Solders, made his Highne≈øs publi≈øh a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, requiring all Commanders in chief, by Beat of Drum, or otherwi≈øe, to call together the ≈øeveral Officers and Soldiers, belonging to their re≈øpective Regiments, Troups, and Companies, in ≈øuch places as they ≈øhould find mo≈øt convenient for their Rendezvouz; and there to keep them in good Order and Di≈øcipline.

            <p>On the 4th. of <hi>December,</hi> His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> came to <hi>Wind≈øor</hi> about Three in the Afternoon, and was received with mo≈øt profound re≈øpect and ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion by the Mayor and Aldermen in their Formalities, the Steward of that Corporation Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating his Arrival in a mo≈øt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Speech; and afterwards he went to the Prince of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Lodgings, prepared for his Reception: And whil≈øt His Highne≈øs was preparing for <hi>London,</hi> News came that the King attempting to pa≈øs the Seas at <hi>Fever≈øham</hi> in di≈øgui≈øe, was ≈øtay'd by ≈øome of the Towns-men who were fearching for ≈øuch as were endeavouring the like, who being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that it was his Maje≈øty, carried him in a rude manner to a hou≈øe in the Town; taking from him ≈øome Jewels, con≈øiderable quantity of Gold, and his Crucifix of a great Value: Not did tho≈øe rude People de≈øi≈øt from their Incivilities, till a Gentleman coming to ≈øee the Pri≈øoners they had taken, and knowing the King, fell on his Knees to pay him duty; whereat the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude being ≈øtrangely ≈øurprized, a great

            <p>The Lords at <hi>White-Hall</hi> hearing of his Maje≈øty's being at <hi>Fever≈øham,</hi> ≈øent to wait upon him, and pray him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Palace Royal; to which he ≈øeemed not at fir≈øt inclinable; though being pre≈ø≈øed to a Return, he at la≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented. But His Highne≈øs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> having fully determined to come to <hi>London</hi> with all ≈øpeed, he thought it in many re≈øpects improper for the King and him≈øelf to be there at one and the ≈øame time in the pre≈øent State of Affairs; upon notice his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty was returning, he ≈øent Mon≈øieur <hi>Zule≈øtein</hi> to meet him on the way, and intreat him to return to <hi>Roche≈øter;</hi> but Mon≈øieur <hi>Zule≈øtein</hi> mi≈ø≈øing him by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king another Road than that by which he came, the King arrived at <hi>White-hall</hi> the 16th. of <hi>December</hi> in the Evening, attended by divers Noblemen, and a Guard of Hor≈øe; and from thence he ≈øent the Lord <hi>Fever≈øham</hi> to invite his Highne≈øs to come to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and

            </p>
            <p>Then the Speaker of the honourable Hou≈øe of Commons put the Hou≈øe in

            <p>After the≈øe and other weighty con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, an Order was made by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, for a publick Thank≈øgiving, for our great and miraculous deliverance from the imminent Danger that ≈øo lately hung over our Heads.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Thus all things concurring towards a happy Settlement, and Uniting of Prote≈øtants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> let us look a little into the Affairs of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which as yet has not the like pro≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, as being very much inhabited by Native Iri≈øh Papi≈øts, devoted Enemies to the Prote≈øtant Religion.

               <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> whom the King had made his Lieutenant, or Deputy of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, taking the advantage of the hurry and di≈øorder the Affairs of <hi>England</hi> had put the People into, magnified their Fears, and u≈øed his endeavours to gain them to a Revolt, but finding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtants in no wi≈øe forward to joyn or take part with him, he in≈øtantly ≈øent his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters through all the Provinces and Countries, to cau≈øe the Gentry and Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øants to take up Arms on the behalf of the King, and the defence of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, declaring, if the King him≈øelf ≈øhould in that juncture de≈øire it, he would not deliver up his Sword; ≈øo that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no endeavours to ≈øtrengthen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf untried, he in a ≈øhort time drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a formidable Army, and ≈øecured divers Places of ≈øtrength, fortifying the Hou≈øes and Ca≈øtles of ≈øeveral Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; whereupon, it was thought fit to ≈øend to him, and know his Intentions; but no farther ≈øatisfaction, at that time, could be gained, than that he was re≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ≈øtand for the King's Intere≈øt, and expect his Commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly upon notice that he, upon his a ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time withdrawing him≈øelf, was in <hi>France,</hi> the Report went currant, that

            <p>His Highne≈øs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> having taken upon him, at the reque≈øt of the Lords and Commons, the farther Admini≈øtration of Government in Civil and Military Affairs, proceeded to the mo≈øt effectual meanes for the better ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Army, and taking care for their Payment; and the better to a≈ø≈øure them, and encourage men of worth and true Valour, the ≈øale of Offices, or Military Employments are laid a≈øide.</p>
            <p>And now the Wi≈ødom of the Nation having thought it, as we head, nece≈ø≈øary to have the pre≈øence of her Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs the Prince≈øs of <hi>Orange</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> upon this great juncture of Affairs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a Convoy of Men of War, as well Engli≈øh as Dutch, was ordered to wait upon her till her Equipage could be got in a readine≈øs and the Wind ≈øerved to bring over her Highne≈øs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The Pomp of the Solemnity being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and night coming on, the Bells and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56844:83"/>Bonfires made a ≈øecond Proclamation of the Peoples Satisfaction, and the news, by the Thundering of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, was in a ≈øhort time carried, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the fire of the Guns from one Ship to another, beyond the I≈øland it ≈øelf; nor were their curious Fire-works and Devices wanting on this Occa≈øion; and the Solemnity was more e≈øpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with Magnificent Entertainments at Court; and ≈øoon after their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øties, with the like Demon≈øtration of Joy, were Proclaimed in all the Cities and Principal Burghs, Towns of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 15th. of <hi>February</hi> His Maje≈øty returned both Hou≈øes a very Gracious An≈øwer to their Declaration, wherein he expre≈ø≈øed Him≈øelf highly ≈øatisfied with what they had done, and was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to promi≈øed them the utmo≈øt of his Care and Protection, for the pre≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Religion, Laws, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties: and that He would be willing to concurr with them in any thing that ≈øhould be for the Good of the Kingdom, and to doe all that in him lay to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Glory and Welfare of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>About this time a Complaint was

            <p>On the 2d. of <hi>February</hi> the Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhop on <hi>London,</hi> with the Clergy of the City, to the number of an 100 waited on their Maje≈øties with an humble Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Fidelity and Duty, and being Graciou≈øly received, were admitted to ki≈øs their Maje≈øties Hands, the King at the ≈øame time being plea≈øed to give them a full A≈ø≈øurance of of his great Affection to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of all the Protection and Encouragement to them, for which he gave them his Royal Word; concluding with A≈ø≈øuring them, that they ≈øhould ever find it ≈øo, and they might depend upon it, the Hou≈øes re≈øolved into a free Parliament. His Maje≈øty went on the 23d. of <hi>February</hi> by Water to the Hou≈øe

            <p>On the 28th. of <hi>February</hi> two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations were i≈ø≈øued forth by the King and Queen, the one at the Reque≈øt of the Honourable Hou≈øe of Commons to apprehend <hi>Robert Brent,</hi> Gentleman, late of the Inner-<hi>Temple,</hi> charged with High Trea≈øon, who procuring him≈øelf to be Bailed had left them, and fled from Ju≈øtice, with the Reward of 200 <abbr>

            <p>And now the duty of Hearth mony being looked upon by the Commons, as a grievance to the Subjects, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented as ≈øuch to his Maje≈øty, the King was plea≈øed to ≈øend a me≈ø≈øage that he left it to their con≈øiderations, either to regulate it, or to take it away, which was received with great ≈øatisfaction, and forthwith the thanks of the Hou≈øe were ordered to be returned his Maje≈øty for his gracious Me≈ø≈øage; and on the 1≈øt. of <hi>March</hi> in the Afternoon, the Knights, Citizens, and Burge≈ø≈øes in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament a≈ø≈øembled, Waited upon his Maje≈øty in the Banqueting-hou≈øe and and there pre≈øented an Addre≈øs of thanks, wherein they expre≈ø≈øed the Joy and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction they conceived at ≈øo unpre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented an offer, humbly craving leave to pre≈øent their A≈ø≈øurance, that they-would make ≈øuch gratefull and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate returns, as were ≈øuitable to his Maje≈øties mo≈øt Gracious Intentions, and be ≈øo carefull of the Support of the Crown that the World ≈øhould ≈øee, to the di≈øcouraging his Enemies, that his Maje≈øty reigns in the Hearts of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>To this his Maje≈øty was plea≈øed to return them a very Gracious An≈øwer, expre≈ø≈øing therein the valuable E≈øteem he had for Parliaments, and e≈øpecially for this, expre≈ø≈øing his Satisfaction of the Confidence and Tru≈øt they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed in him, and that it ≈øhould be his Care never to give any Parliament cau≈øe of di≈øtru≈øt; and withall recommending to them the care of the Allies abroad, and minding them of the greate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the States of <hi>Holland</hi> had been at in the Expedition and Zeal they had to promote it, and to ≈øecond his Maje≈øties

            <p>About this time we had News that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt part of the Regiment of Foot, late com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Lord <hi>Dumbarton,</hi> and ≈øome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Fuziliers, made a Mutiny near <hi>Ip≈øwych,</hi> and ≈øeized on the Money ≈øent down to pay them, with four Field-pieces, and refu≈øing to obey the King's Orders, marched away, doing great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and bringing a greater terrour upon the Country people, proclaiming King <hi>James,</hi> &amp;c. whereupon both hou≈øes Addre≈ø≈øed his Maje≈øty that he would be plea≈øed to take ≈øuch effectual Cour≈øe, as in his Princely Wi≈ødom ≈øhould be thought fit for the ≈øuppre≈ø≈øing and bringing them to Ju≈øtice; and that in the mean time he would i≈ø≈øue out his Royal Proclamation, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them and their Adherents to be Rebels and Traitors, requiring all good Subjects to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ≈øubdue and pro≈øecute them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which His Maje≈øty was plea≈øed to an≈øwer, That he thanked both Hou≈øes for their Addre≈øs, and that he had ≈øent a Force of Hor≈øe and Dragoons ≈øufficient to ≈øuppre≈øs them, and that he would i≈ø≈øue out a Proclamation, as was de≈øired.</p>
            <p>On the 16th of <hi>March</hi> His Maje≈øty went by water to the Hou≈øe of Lords, attended with the u≈øual Solemnity, and being in his Royal Robes, ≈øeated on the Throne, and the Commons ≈øent for up, His Maje≈øty gave the Royal A≈ø≈øent to an Act impowering him to apprehend ≈øuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons as he ≈øhould find ju≈øt cau≈øe to ≈øu≈øpect are

            <p>On the 14th of <hi>March,</hi> in obedience to the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Letter, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons a≈ø≈øembled at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in one Hou≈øe, as the Cu≈øtome is, and cho≈øe Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> their Pre≈øident, and con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Duke of <hi>Gourdon,</hi> a Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, held the Ca≈øtle, who≈øe Cannon commanded the City, they made an Act, by which they empowered the Earls of <hi>Lothain</hi> and <hi>Tweddale</hi> to repair immediately to the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and to require him and others of his per≈øua≈øion there, in the Name of the E≈øtates of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to remove out of that Ca≈øtle in twenty four hours after notice given, and to leave the Charge thereof to the next commanding Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, being a Prote≈øtant, and that he, and tho≈øe that were with him, upon ≈øuch a compliance, ≈øhould have a≈ø≈øurance from the E≈øtates, to be ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and indempnified as to any thing they had acted in that or any other Station, contrary to Law, as being Papi≈øts.</p>
            <p>This done, they nominated a Committee of Election con≈øi≈øting of 15 per≈øons, five of each E≈øtate, and after ≈øome debate, whether the Lords Spiritual were a di≈øtinct E≈øtate, or only a part of the ≈øame E≈øtate with the Lords Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, which was laid a≈øide by the Hou≈øe, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Negative, and rejecting the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtations again≈øt the ≈øitting of the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> before his Father's Attainder was taken off.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56844:91"/>to prevent di≈øorders, it was not inconvenient to command all per≈øons, who were not Inhabitants, nor immediately belonging to the Members of this Convention, to depart the place, but it was the Opinion of the Hou≈øe, that the Ca≈øtle, in the command of who≈øe Cannon the City was, ought to be fir≈øt ≈øurrendered, and for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a≈ø≈øurance, a Committee was ordered to take care that no violation of the Peace were made.
