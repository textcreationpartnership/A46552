            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE weight of this illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Subject might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a greater <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker, and made me have kept at an awfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, whilſt the moſt celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Pens of <hi>Europe</hi> had interwoven and enamell'd the Birth and Riſing, Glories of ſo great a Prince, with all the Rhetorical and Heroick Accents and Expreſſions that are capable of giving Life and Fire to the Minds of Men, and raiſing their Souls to a highth capable of knowing the Centre of true Greatneſs; but with humble ſubmiſſion, not finding any forward in ſo invaluable an Enterprize, I, though unworthy, have preſumed to
<pb facs="tcp:56844:4"/>make this Eſſay, hoping it will not be taken ill, ſince this, at leaſt, is the Ground-work, upon which the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring Hiſtorian muſt build, when he conſults the Golden Rolls of Fame to raiſe a Pyramid of laſting Honour to the Memories of the World's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Worthies. In this Book, though ſmall to appearance, you may find things as vaſt in Extent as Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Valour can enlarge them; and when I tell you it is the Compendium of the Birth and Actions of the Great and Renowned Prince of the Houſe of <hi>Orange,</hi> with what more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relates to his Redeeming us from Popery and Slavery, by his generous Expedition, Valour, and Conduct, I might be ſilent, ſince the World is ſufficiently ſenſible of what I farther intend; yet that Poſterity may not forget ſo great a Deliverance, it is fit that it ſhould be Recorded till Time is ſwallowed up in Eternity.</p>
            <p>You have, Reader, in this Book an
<pb facs="tcp:56844:4"/>Account of the illuſtrious Birth of a Prince, born to be the Protectour of the true Religion, and the Support (next the Almighty Arm) of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, coming neareſt to its primitive Purity, with his Advancement to early Honours, and his memorable Actions from time to time, with the various dangers and hazards to which he has expoſed himſelf, for the Repoſe of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> but more eſpecially for the ſecuring and promoting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion. You have likewiſe a Diſcovery of Popiſh Cruelties, in the wretched State and Condition of the Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> under the late Perſecution, from which you may gather what we might have expected and ſuffered, had not this great Prince at ſo much Coſt, hazard of his Perſon, and indefatigable Labour and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, diſpell'd with the Rays of his early and glorious Succeſs, the cloudy Tempest that was breaking over our Heads; and to be brief, you have an
<pb facs="tcp:56844:5"/>Account of all that has memorably paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from his Birth to this day, and that more particularly in <hi>England,</hi> upon the ever-to-be-remembered Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his coming over as our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour and Deliverer, with the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable Induſtry he has ſucceſsfully uſed to infatuate and defeat the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of our Enemies, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns he has found from a ſenſible and gratefull People, and eſpecially the Wiſdom of the Nation Aſſembled in Parliament, in Proclaiming and Crowning him, together with his Royal Conſort, King and Queen of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. with the manner of the performance, and what elſe can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to ſet forth ſo illuſtrious an History, the Subject of which may ſome Angel ſound with a golden Trumpet to the utmoſt Kingdoms of the Earth: which is the Wiſh of</p>

            <head>An Hiſtorical Account of the Life and memorable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Henry,</hi> King of Great <hi>Britain, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHen we undertake to Write of illuſtrious Perſons, whoſe great Actions are ſufficiently known to the World, and whoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Candour have placed them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Pinacle of Fame, it is then that Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical Strains, or flattering Applauſe, is altogether to be laid aſide, as vain and uſeleſs; for true Diamonds require not the Art to ſet them off, like Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits, but relying upon their proper Luſtre make their value known, and ſhine in a kind of careleſs Glory; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſidering the Illuſtrious Subject I am here to handle, waving elaborate Circumſtances, and Expreſſions not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56844:6"/>pertinent to Hiſtory, or Matters of this kind; my Care and Endeavour ſhall be to keep to Truth and Fact, and as much as in me lies to give a ſatisfactory Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Birth and glorious Actions of a Prince, whoſe Fame has travell'd with the Sun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WIlliam Henry,</hi> of the Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> our preſent Sovereign, deſcended from that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>German</hi> Family, that has been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Famous, and to which the <hi>Empire</hi> and all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> has been ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden, Son to <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> by the Royal Princeſs <hi>Mary,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Charles</hi> I. King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c. was Born on the 14th. of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> in the year of our Lord, 1650. his Father dying the preceding Month, after he had been Married about nine Years, and done Actions worthy of his high Birth, in the Four and Twentieth year of his Age, leaving this hopefull, Iſſue to diſpell the Clouds of Sorrow that began to ſpread themſelves over moſt <hi>European</hi> Courts, upon notice of a Death ſo unexpected, and a Loſs ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant.</p>
            <p>This great Prince at his Baptiſm had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56844:6"/>for Godfathers the Lords <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> and the Cities of <hi>Amſterdam, Delf,</hi> and <hi>Leyden,</hi> receiving the Name of <hi>William Henry;</hi> and as he increaſed in years, under the Care of the indulgent Princeſs, and ſuch as were appointed to attend and wait upon him, he gave early hope of what hath ſince been ſufficiently manifeſted.</p>
            <p>At five years of Age he came to viſit his Uncle, King <hi>Charles</hi> II who then was at <hi>Breda,</hi> preparing for <hi>England,</hi> to take Poſſeſſion of the Thrones and Kingdoms, ſo long detained from him; where the King expreſſed his extraordinary ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ſee the Prince his Nephew, and highly welcomed him; and ſoon after the <hi>Eſtates General,</hi> having a particular Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the King, recommending the firmneſs and fidelity of that Republick to his Intereſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his Majeſty in the moſt obliging Terms replyed, <hi>That the Intereſt, if no other Motives ſhould induce him to it, of two Perſons ſo nearly allied to him, as the Princeſs Royal his Siſter, and the Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>his Nephew, who live in the Eſtate as part of it, muſt unavoidably endear it to him.</hi> However, there were many Reaſons of State, which obliged him to make with thoſe Provinces a moſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56844:7"/>ſtrict Alliance: And now the King's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture for <hi>England</hi> being at hand, the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates General</hi> named Mr. <hi>De Gent.</hi> Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Guelderland, Guelderwagen</hi> of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Lampſins</hi> of <hi>Zeland,</hi> to wait upon the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who was then with the King, and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Gloucester,</hi> who Lodged in the Extroardinary Ambaſſador's Houſe, to complement them on the Re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King, and the Revolution of the Affairs of <hi>England;</hi> and at the ſame time Mr. <hi>Renſwonde</hi> of <hi>Utreicht, Ripperdo</hi> of <hi>Hengelo,</hi> of <hi>Overyſel,</hi> together with <hi>Isbrants</hi> of <hi>Groning,</hi> were deputed to the ſame Office, by the Princeſs Royal, and the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King being treated by the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates General</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> he ſitting at the middle of the Table-head, had on the Right Hand the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> on the Left the Princeſs Royal, and there the Prince was preſent, a Seat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed on purpoſe for him to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh his Character, though in his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der years, from Lords of great Rank and Quality, who were preſent at that ſplendid Entertainment; and this order was obſerved whenever he Dined pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly with the King, which he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56844:7"/>did, as well at the <hi>Hague,</hi> as at other places; and when the King left the <hi>Hague,</hi> his Highneſs, accompanied with Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> Governour of <hi>Friezeland,</hi> with ſundry Nobles and Gentlemen, went before him towards the Ships, on which, together with his Train, he was to embark for <hi>England;</hi> and when he went on Board he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the Admiral's Ship by the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Princeſs Royal, and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to whom at his Departure he returned moſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Thanks, and endearing Expreſſions of Affection, which ended not but with his Life. Theſe were the remarkable Paſſages (as I may term them) in the Infancy of this great Prince: But it is time to go on to thoſe of his riper years.</p>
            <p>A prevailing Faction growing up in the United Provinces, managed by Stateſmen that ambitiouſly ſtrove to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs the Power, and enrich themſelves as much as in them lay, to overſhadow the Brightneſs of this Riſing Sun, to eclipſe the Family that had laid the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Foundation of the <hi>State,</hi> and by which Providence would have it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, though at the ſame time <hi>France</hi> preſſed them with a prevailing Army.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56844:8"/>Amongſt thoſe of the Faction, the <hi>De Wits</hi> were very forward, for which, and ſome underhand Practices againſt the Perſon of the Prince, the two Brothers, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> ſoon after felt the Rage of the People, who out them to pieces; however thoſe that remained ſtruggled to keep themſelves in Power; and the better to doe it, disbanded their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Forces and Officers, putting in their ſteads the Sons of Burgher-maſters, and ſuch others as they ſuppoſed would ſtickle for them againſt the Intereſt, of this Riſing Prince; however it laſted not, for within a while the French taking more effectually the advantage of this overſight, ſwept away divers of the Frontier Towns, and entered deep, with great ravagement and devaſtation, into ſome of the Provinces, which made the People conſider of a General to lead their Forces; whereupon in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the year 1672. the Prince was inveſted with the Titles of Captain, and Admiral General of the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Honours his Anceſtors had a long time meritoriouſly enjoyed to the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary contentment of the People, by having (next under God) been the chief means of reducing thoſe Provinces from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56844:8"/>Slavery into a <hi>State;</hi> when his Highneſs, Marching at the Head of a few Troups, made good his Poſt at <hi>Nienkop</hi> againſt the violent Attacks and Incroachments of the French, and ſo gallantly ordered Affairs, that he made them retire with loſs.</p>
            <p>Upon the Ravage the French had made on the Frontiers, the people of the Province of <hi>Holland</hi> grew diſcontented and diſpleaſed with their Magiſtrates, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing the Miſfortune to their neglect; ſo that thoſe of <hi>Dort</hi> broke into open Mutiny, demanding to ſee the Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines; but being put off, or refuſed, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſome Treachery, they reſolved to have the Prince made Stateholder, nor would they by any means be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, till he was ſent for, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in that Dignity, which being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into an Act, great joy enſued amongſt the People; and ſoon after the other Cities and Provinces conſented to the like Inveſtment, and his Highneſs took his Place in the Hall of Audience, with the Ceremonies the Dignity required.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Proceedings, and his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's returning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o the Army at <hi>Bode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove,</hi> the Face of things were changed, and the late drooping Provinces ſeemed to take new Life and Vigour; the French
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56844:9"/>were manfully reſiſted, and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> forced from the Walls of <hi>Groning</hi> by a ſlender Gariſon, after the Loſs of a great part of his Army; ſo that now the Prince being very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the Hearts of the people, the <hi>De Wits</hi> were ſacrificed to the popular Fury, for conſpiring againſt him &amp; the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the Burghers and others ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Arms, and breaking in upon them, where <hi>Cornelius</hi> was impriſoned by the Magiſtrates, and his Brother <hi>John</hi> at that time come to ſee him, they dragged them thence with great Cries, and after a miſerable miſ-uſage, hung them up by the Heels in the Market-place, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to pieces, ſold their Joints and Fleſh by piece-meal, at great Rates, which were carried away by the Buyers in a Triumph of Revenge.</p>
            <p>The <hi>De Wits</hi> falling thus from their highth of Honour, <hi>Min Heer Fagel</hi> was made Pentionary with the Prince's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; and indeed deſervedly, having been the firſt, when only Pentioner of <hi>Haerlem,</hi> to open peoples Eyes upon the inevitable Ruine that muſt have atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the continuance of the <hi>De Wits</hi> Miniſtry, and thereupon the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> wrote a moſt obliging Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56844:9"/>to the <hi>States,</hi> to let them know he had received the News of the Prince's Advancement and Settlement in the Honours and Dignities of his Anceſtors, and to aſſure them of his Friendſhip and good Will; ſo that the Provinces within themſelves being ſettled, it was thought high time to oppoſe the Inſults of the French; whereupon the Prince marched to diſlodge their Out-gaurds, and came upon them ſo unexpectedly and with ſo much terrour as they lay at the Seige of <hi>Utreicht,</hi> that he beat them into their Trenches, and took ſeveral Priſoners of Note, which he commended to be kindly uſed, and ſent to <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> And now there being a Rumour that ſome Attempt was deſigned againſt his Highneſs's Perſon, by ſome private means; ſo far it wrought, that from that time he has been entreated to accept of a Guard for his Perſon, and although the ſeaſon was far advanced, he laid Seige to <hi>Woerden,</hi> a conſiderable Gariſon, held by the French, to the relief of which the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> haſted, and was the firſt time obliged to retire with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable loſs; but returning with a great Re-inforcement, as the Toown was about to Capitulate, after an obſtinate
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56844:10"/>Fight, and many kill'd on both ſides, he put a ſuccour of 300 Men into it, and with conſiderable Loſs retreated. This new recruit encouraging the Gariſon, and the Prince having loſt in the Action Collonel <hi>Suyleſteyme</hi> (who bore the fury of the Attack, and faught valiantly, but being over-powered, and refuſing Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was killed,) as likewiſe other brave Men, and now the Weather more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoding his Army than the Enemy, he thought it convenient to riſe from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and drew off without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation.</p>
            <p>After theſe Proceedings, his Highneſs held a Council of War, and having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven neceſſary Orders, marched to <hi>Roſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> where the General Rendezvouz were appointed, and there having mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered an Army to the number of 24000. he took his March towards the Country of <hi>Liege,</hi> and obliged the Count <hi>de Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> to retire to <hi>Staſſemburgh</hi> with the Army he then had under his Command, being deſirous, if it might conveniently be, to give him Battel: but underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the Count frequently ſhifted his Quarters, in a kind of a retiring man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Prince after inveſting <hi>Tongeren</hi> with his own and ſuch Spaniſh Forces as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56844:10"/>had joyned with him; and by that means not being able to draw him to a Battel, he re-paſſed the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and after ſome longer attendence to that purpoſe, he marched to <hi>Maeſtreicht,</hi> and ſent a Party of Horſe and Foot to take in the Caſtle of <hi>Valcheren,</hi> which ſoon ſurrendred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſcretion; and there they found a conſiderable Megazine, eſpecially of Forage: And after that his Highneſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inveſted <hi>Charleroy</hi> without ſucceſs, by reaſon of the ſharpneſs of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and taken <hi>Birch,</hi> an important Place, defended by three Captains, and 300. Soldiers, Demoliſhing the Town, he marched through <hi>Brabant,</hi> and put his Soldiers into Winter Quarters.</p>
            <p>During theſe Tranſactions, the French in conſiderable Parties taking the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the hard Froſt, marched over the Ice, and made ſome inconſiderable ſpoil in the Villages, but upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of his Highneſs they retired in diſorder, with conſiderable loſs; and had the Paſſes been defended as the <hi>States</hi> directed, moſt of them had peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the Waters, by reaſon of the ſudden Thaw that enſued. About this time, to make amends for the miſchief the French had done <hi>Coeverden,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56844:11"/>covered a Place of great importance, and from whence the Gariſon-Soldiers, by their frequent Inroads, had greatly endamaged the Country. And now his Highneſs induſtriouſly laboured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe home-bred Differences and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, which he effected with the ſame facility that attended all his undertakings, inſomuch that all Animoſities were laid aſide, and every Man apply'd himſelf to promote the publick good of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and then he proceeded to viſit the Fortifications, and give ſuch neceſſary Orders, as the Juncture of Affairs requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>The Spring advancing, the French King made great preparations againſt <hi>Holland,</hi> invading them in Perſon with a powerfull Army, whilſt the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped at <hi>Utriecht,</hi> expecting Orders to fall into the County. They had now likewiſe War with the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> with whoſe powerfull Navy the French joyn'd; which made the the Prince to be very carefull in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the motion of the French by Land, whilſt the <hi>States</hi> prepared to ſet out their Naval Forces; nor was ſuch a Storm as then threatened the Provinces, to be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56844:11"/>ſlightly regarded; for the French King laid Siege to <hi>Maeſtriecht,</hi> with an Army of 42000 Horſe and Foot, on the 10th. of <hi>June,</hi> it being before blocked up by the Count <hi>De l' Orge,</hi> with three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe: In this place was a Gariſon of about eight or nine hundred Horſe, and four thouſand Foot, Commanded by the valiant <hi>Monſieur d' Fariaux,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the place with much Bravery to the laſt extremity, killing the French a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 9000 Soldiers, beſides Officers, and Men of great note; and then at the Petition and earneſt Intreaty of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, ſurrendered upon honourable terms, and was ſoon after, for his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and prudent Conduct, made, by his Highneſs, Major General of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: And at this Seige it was that the unfortunate Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſignali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed his Valour to the highth of Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; by which, and the Courage of the Engliſh under his Command, the French King may be juſtly ſaid to make himſelf Maſter of this Place; after which, the French Army being drawn off, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſperſed; the Prince drew together his Forces, and laid Siege to <hi>Maerd,</hi> ſtraitening it with 25000 Horſe and Foot, which obliged the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56844:12"/>to bend his Forces that way; however the Place was taken without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in four days, and <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>About this time the <hi>States</hi> entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a League, with the Emperour and King of <hi>Spain</hi> againſt <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies joyning, at leaſt in part, the Seige of <hi>Bonne</hi> was pitch'd upon, into which the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had only the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of putting 100 Horſe, who paſſed the Centinels under pretence of being the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Party, and 100 more attempting to doe the like through the Prince's Quarters, not only failed of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but were moſt of them killed and taken Priſoners, and 500 more, who were to ſupport them, obliged to retreat being beholden for their ſafety to the ſwiftneſs of their Horſes: And now the Town was cloſely preſſed by the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Army, and the Governour ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned; and although at the firſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, yet perceiving the reſolution of the Beſiegers to ſpare none they found in Arms if the Town was taken by Storm, and the vigorous Attacks they made, at the end of ſeven days a Parley was beat, and the Beſieged granted honourable terms; they marched out to the number
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56844:12"/>of 1500, ſo that with little loſs of Bloud the Confederates became Maſters of this City; upon which the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> drew off to <hi>Weſſeling;</hi> and commanding in the abſence of <hi>Montecuculi</hi> the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Army, he ſeized on the Caſtles of <hi>Lech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nich</hi> and <hi>Brevel;</hi> and now Succeſs atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Sword, he conſtrained the French, although <hi>Turene</hi> had taken the Field with a conſiderable Army, to quit many Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they conceived not to be tenable, or at leaſt ways to draw out the Gariſons to recruit their Army, which was not in a condition to make head againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates: Amongſt thoſe that they quitted was <hi>Herderwick, Woerden, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treicht, Bomniel, Campen, Elburg,</hi> and <hi>Hattein,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who was in League with <hi>France,</hi> quitted <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> and <hi>Stenwick;</hi> yet at their Departure they exacted great Summes of Mony from the Inhabitants in lieu of their not firing the Houſes; yet they diſmantled many of them, and left viſible tokens of their Anger, for being conſtrained to quit thoſe important Places which they had gained at at a vaſt expence of Bloud and Treaſure. So far did the terrour of a young General in this Riſing Glories
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56844:13"/>work upon the minds of this late inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Nation, that they who had lately carried Ruine and Devaſtation into the nighbouring Country, began now to ſhrink together in their own.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the principal Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the end of the year 1673. and in gratitude for the Services his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had done the <hi>States</hi> by his Valour and Conduct, in freeing them from the Danger of their capital Enemies, and recovering ſo many wealthy Towns, they confirmed to him the Dignity of Stateholder, for the Provinces of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Weſt Friezeland,</hi> paſſing a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to hold it not only for his Life, but to ſettle it upon the Heirs Male of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in lawfull Marriage, for ever. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which his Highneſs for a time, made it his Buſineſs with indefatigable care and induſtry, to ſettle the Province of <hi>Utreicht,</hi> and other Countrys that had been diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and put out of order by the Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the French, and made ſuch Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and good Regulation of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that had been ſhaken and put out of frame, by the ſundry &amp; ſudden Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he ſettled Matters to the adm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iration &amp; content of all Perſons that had to doe in it, ſo that they unanimouſly vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56844:13"/>him Governour-General, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-General of the Province of <hi>Utreicht,</hi> and the honour to deſcend to his Heirs Male, lawfully born in Wedlock.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things were doing, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Rebenhaupt,</hi> being aboard with a ſtrong Party, took <hi>Northom,</hi> and put a Gariſon into it, beat the <hi>Munſter</hi> Forces, that in his abſence were endeavouring to re-take it; and marched onward, ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Nigenbuys,</hi> yet the Gariſon retiring to a little Caſtle, capable of making but a ſlender reſiſtence, were ſpared upon their throwing down their Arms, and begging Quarter: But upon his going into Winter Quarters, and diſperſing his Men, General <hi>Negal,</hi> with the <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> Forces under his Command, recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the latter. However, the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> perceiving the Tempeſt of War to gather about his Countries, and finding the French King no way able to ſupport him, he thought it high time to treat of Peace, and accordingly clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up one with the Emperour, which more and more diſcouraged the French, ſo that the Marqueſs of <hi>Belefouds,</hi> who ſucceeded the <hi>Mareſchal d' Humiers</hi> in the <hi>Netherland</hi> Acquiſitions, thought of nothing more than the deſerting the Towns that yet remained.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56844:14"/>
            <p>And in order to this, upon notice that the Prince was marching into <hi>Brabant</hi> with 30000 Men to joyn the Spaniſh For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Tiel, Arnheim, Zutphen,</hi> and others, were ſlighted, but not without great Summes of Money extorted from the Inhabitants, to ſave them from Plunder and Burning; the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe relinquiſhed <hi>Devenenter,</hi> ſo that all <hi>Overyſel</hi> was at entire Liberty, and had thoſe Diſorders the Enemy occaſioned in Government rectified and reſtored by his Highneſs's ſpecial Command, though for quitting theſe Towns the Marqueſs loſt the French King's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and was for bidden the Court, the better to colour the Buſineſs, which his neceſſity, paſt all peradventure, had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged him to doe; yet to repair this loſs he fell into the French <hi>Conte,</hi> and took <hi>Dole, Malins,</hi> and <hi>Becanſon,</hi> making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in a ſhort time, Maſter of that entire Province: This made his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> repair the ſooner to the Army at <hi>Bargen Opzoon,</hi> marching from thence to <hi>Mallins,</hi> guarding the Fronteirs of <hi>Brabant,</hi> ſo that the French, though abroad with two powerfull Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, durſt attempt nothing farther on that ſide.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:56844:14"/>
            <p>The Confederate Armies joyning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of <hi>July,</hi> The Generals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, That Count <hi>Souches</hi> ſhould lead the Van, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> the Main Battel, and the Rear-Guard to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Count <hi>Montery,</hi> and ſo they proceeded to oblige the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who lay encamped with the greateſt ſtrength of the French power, to a Battel; but not being able to draw him to it, and perceiving the ſtill fortified his Camp, the Confederate Armies drew off, in order to beſiege and take in ſome Places of Importance, which <hi>Conde</hi> no ſooner perceived, and underſtanding the difficult ways they were to paſs, but he drew out and purſued the Rear-Guard, as knowing the Van-Guard and Main Battalia were a great way advanced, and charged the Prince of <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> who conſiſted moſt of Horſe, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him to ſend to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> for two Battalians of Foot, who ſent him three, under the Command of young Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> and ſoon after the entire Army engaged by degrees in a doubtfull and bloudy Fight, near the River <hi>Seneff,</hi> where at firſt the French had the advantage, by reaſon the Confederate Army being, as is ſaid, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56844:15"/>could not ſo ſoon unite as was convenient; however the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> in concluſion was obliged to draw off, and quit the Field, with the loſs of about 7000 Men, and amonſt them ſundry great Officers and Voluntiers of note: Nor did the Confederates loſe leſs than 6000, and amongſt them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Noble-men, beſides thoſe that were wounded and taken Priſoners on both ſides: And in this Battel, which laſted for about the ſpace of ſix or ſeven hours, his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſpared not to hazard his Perſon in the greateſt danger, labouring with his Voice and Example to encourage his Men, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Battel where he found it bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and diſordered, by rallying the Troups and Battalions, cauſing thoſe that ſhrunk or gave back to advance, and with his Sword in his hand, led them on to face the danger, omitting nothing that became a great and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced General; inſomuch that General <hi>Souches,</hi> a Man of great prudence and large underſtanding, gives a Character of him to the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> in theſe words.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>I have endeavoured</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my Duty, in attending his Highneſs
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56844:15"/>the Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>during the famous, though bloudy, Battel between the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Army and that of the moſt Chriſtian King, the happy Iſſue of which has proved very much to the Glory of the Prince, who ſhewed, upon that occaſion, the Prudence of an aged Captain, the Courage of a</hi> Caeſar, <hi>and the un daunted Bravery of a</hi> Marius; <hi>all which, My Lords, is delivered by me without Flattery, which is contrary to my Nature,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            <p>The Fight being over, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates with a ſtrong Party keeping the Field all Night, the Prince the next day marched by <hi>Mons</hi> with his whole Army, and was recruited at St. <hi>Gilain</hi> with five Dutch Regiments, and there he Quartered, whilſt the Imperialiſts march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Queverain;</hi> when ſoon after Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Rabenhaupt</hi> laid Siege to the <hi>Greves,</hi> a ſtrong Gariſon poſſeſſed by the French, and as ſtoutly defended, inſomuch that he had been undoubtedly obliged to quit that Siege, had not the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> perfected it by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence he gave; for the Gariſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of 4000 Foot, and 9 Troups of Horſe, and in it 450 pieces of Cannon, a hundred of them mounted, beſides a large ſtore of Ammunition and Proviſion,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56844:16"/>yet this ſtrong place yielded to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable Fortune of the Prince; for finding the Imperialiſts and <hi>Spaniards</hi> not forward to hazard a ſecond Battel with <hi>Conde,</hi> who was by this time conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly re-inforced, leaving the Groſs of his Army with Prince <hi>Waldeck,</hi> he came to the Siege of this place with 60 Troups of Horſe, which ſo animated the Beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and daunted the Beſieged, that the Marqueſs <hi>De Chamilly,</hi> Governour of the Town, finding the great Breaches that were made in the Walls, and the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief done by the ſpringing of the Mines, he began to conclude it could not hold out a reſolute Aſſault, and ſo coming to a Parley, obtained honourable Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; by which means the Curb that this ſtrong Gariſon had put upon the nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries was happily taken off, and the Troups for the moſt part were put into Winter Quarters, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Action happened till the enſuing Spring; yet in conſideration of the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Services the Prince had done the <hi>States,</hi> they of <hi>Guelderland</hi> offered him as an addition to his other Honours, the Sovereignty of the Dutchy of <hi>Guelders,</hi> &amp; the County of <hi>Zutphen;</hi> and though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provinces intimated at the ſame time
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56844:16"/>that they would doe the like, yet he would in modeſty accept of no other than that of Governour Hereditary of thoſe Provinces; and being confirmed therein, his firſt care was to ſettle the Affairs that had been diſordered, as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently foreſeeing that nothing conduces more to the happineſs of a Country, than a good Conſtitution of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>In the year 1675 the French by their great preparations demonſtrating their early Intentions to take the Field, the Confederates conſulted the beſt methods for the carrying on the War againſt <hi>France:</hi> But whilſt that was doing the Prince fell ſick of the Small-Pox, which Diſtemper having proved fatal to many of his near Relations, created a ſadneſs not only throughout the Provinces, but almoſt every where where the news came; yet it laſted not; for in a ſhort time, through the diligence and induſtry of his Phyſicians, great ſigns of Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appeared, which ended in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect recovery of his Health; when, as ſoon as his ſtrength would permit him, he haſted to the general Rendezvouz, near <hi>Roſendale,</hi> the better to attend the French King's motion, who was by this time in

And now the Winter-ſeaſon advancing, and the time of Action over, his Highneſs left the Army under the Command of Count <hi>Waldeck,</hi> and returned to <hi>Holland,</hi> where he was received with many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of joy, and proceeded to give the general Aſſembly of States an Account of that Summers Campaign, ſo much to their ſatisfaction, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in a moſt ſolemn manner congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated his ſafe Return, in his own, and in the names of all the States there aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: As likewiſe did the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by the Penſioner <hi>Fagel,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging all the Kindneſs and Gratitude imaginable, for the Care and Pains he had taken, and the Danger he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Perſon to for the Honour and Service of the State.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56844:25"/>to ſtand by and defend each other, till they could oblige the French King to Reaſon; the Engliſh Parliament at the ſame time declaring ſtrongly for it, and offering the King conſiderable Summes of Mony to carry on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Deſign againſt the Diſturber of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Alliance was to be carried on in order to the recovering a ſatisfaction by ſuch means as ſhould be thought moſt expedient and beſt agreeable; and indeed for a time it was vigorouſly maintained, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> preſſing it with a more than ordinary Ardour, and the King ſent the Lord <hi>Montague</hi> his Ambaſſadour to <hi>France,</hi> once more to preſs that King to a Compliance, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at the ſame time new Levies of Horſe and Foot: However the French King rejecting the Propoſitions, was not idle, but made great preparations for War; whereupon the King of Great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> recalled his Forces that were in the French Service, who were ſent home without their Arrears.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56844:27"/>Army, and from thence march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward <hi>Rockleſs,</hi> advancing the left Wing as far as the Abby of St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> that Place being the Duke of <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>'s chief Quarters, facing with his Right Wing <hi>Caſteau,</hi> poſſeſſed likewiſe by the French; and although the Paſſes were extreme difficult, which rendred the French more ſecure, yet the Army being embatteled, his Highneſs comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Party to drive the French from a Hillock they had poſſeſſed, which was performed with little difficulty; and then he cauſed the great Guns to play upon the Enemy that had poſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves near the Cloiſter, adjacent to the Town; and though they ſtrove to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it with their Cannon, yet after a conſiderable Battery, a Party of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons advanced, and after a ſharp diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute drove them thence, and poſſeſſed the Place, when in the mean time Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant General <hi>Collyer,</hi> ſeconded by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Delwick,</hi> paſſed the <hi>Defiles,</hi> or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row dirty Lanes, with admirable cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, contrary to the expectation of the French, and drove them, after a ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſiſtence, into their own Lines; when the Prince, accompanied by the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who fought by his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56844:28"/>ſide that day, fell in with great reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and bravery, encouraging by words and actions the Regiments that were advanced, and ſignallizing his Valour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Report, which ſo animated the Regiments of the left Wing that they followed each other till the Evening charging with great reſolution; and Count <hi>Horn</hi> bending the Cannon under his Charge againſt the Battalions of French that were drawn up in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, it greatly endamaged them by battering their Ranks.</p>
            <p>The Fight being thus begun, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on and maintained with much reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and bravery, the Prince, forcing his Paſſage to <hi>Caſteau,</hi> which had been Attacked by the Spaniards in the right Wing, where his Regiments of Foot-Guards had the Van-Guard under the Command of Count <hi>Solms,</hi> and was ſeconded by the Regiments of <hi>Holſtein, Roques, Sereres,</hi> and they ſupported by the Engliſh, who through the natural averſion they had to the French, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with ſuch fury, that the obſtinate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence the Enemy made could not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain their impetuoſity; for after five hours diſpute the French were driven from their Poſt by the Regiments of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56844:28"/>Guards, who purſued them to the River <hi>Haines,</hi> on the other ſide of <hi>Caſteau:</hi> And in this Battel it was that the renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> who commanded the Engliſh, ſignalized his Valour; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the whole ſtreſs of the Battel lay upon the Infantry, the Cavalry not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſerviceable in a Place of ſuch narrow acceſs, and ſo full of precipices. Night putting an end to the Slaughter, the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> finding his loſs great, and that he was no longer capable of making good his Poſt, drew off, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the favour of the darkneſs of the Night, in much Silence and Confuſion, and took a new Poſt nearer <hi>Mons,</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his Army with a Wood on the one ſide, and on the other it was ſecured by a River, leaving behind him moſt of the wounded Men, with many Tents, and much Baggage and Ammunition.</p>
            <p>The Prince upon this advantage, would have purſued the French to have given them a total Defeat, and free the Town of <hi>Mons</hi> from the apprehenſion of Danger: But whilſt he was preparing to make a ſecond Attack, an Expreſs was ſent him, that the Treaty was ſigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the States and the French King; however, they congratulated his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56844:29"/>upon this Succeſs, in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner, intreating him to be more ſparing of their ſafety than to hazard himſelf in the midſt of danger; and the better to demonſtrate at how dear a rate they eſteemed his preſervation, they ſent to Mr. <hi>Owerkirks</hi> (a Perſon who had enterpoſed himſelf between the Prince and a French Captain, that in the heat of the Fight was in a full Carier to charge him at adiſadvantage) a Sword, whoſe Hilt was of Maſſy Gold, a pair of Piſtols inlay'd with Gold and a pair of golden Horſe-buckles.</p>
            <p>Upon the News that the Treaty was ſigned, a Ceſſation of Arms enſued, and upon the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi>'s drawing off to the Country between the <hi>Muſe</hi> and <hi>Sambre,</hi> the Prince marched to <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſines,</hi> upon the Road to <hi>Nivelle,</hi> and there being no farther Buſineſs in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to warlike Action, he came to the <hi>Hague,</hi> where he was received by the People, with the higheſt demonſtration of Joy and Acclamation; and this laſt ſucceſs no doubt haſtened the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Treaty between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which was agreed on the 17th. of <hi>November</hi> following, yet it laſted not long, before the French King upon the claiming ſeveral places in the Spaniſh
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56844:29"/>
               <hi>Netherlands</hi> as Dependencies, blocked up <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> which obliged the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> Guarrantee of the Peace, to interpoſe his Authority, as likewiſe did the States, by way of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation; but the French King would not hearken to the quitting the claim he had laid, unleſs the City of <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> might be put into his Poſſeſſion, with all its Dependencies, three Leagues round it; which being long debated, and the time the French King gave to come to a Reſolve being expired, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out concluding any thing of that Affair, the <hi>Mareſchal d' Humieres</hi> fell into the Spaniſh Provinces with a numerous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and put them under Contribution, making great ſpoil, and ravage in many places; and not ſo contented, but upon the Prince of <hi>Chimai</hi>'s (Governour of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi>) acting ſome Hoſtilities in their Territories, the <hi>Mareſchal</hi> laid Siege to, and took <hi>Courtray,</hi> burning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of leſſer note, conſtraining o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to pay a Ranſome for ſaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Fire; and in concluſion, the <hi>Mareſchal d' Crequi</hi> came before <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> with an Army of 30000 Men, and caſt a great number of Bombs into that City, which burnt and demoliſhed about

Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but they being not willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into any new Engagement of War with <hi>France,</hi> the Ambaſſadours could not perſuade them to make new Levies, or to ſend any Forces to the Aſſiſtence of His Catholick Majeſty; nor could the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56844:30"/>give any aſſiſtence, by reaſon of the ſtorm that threatened him at that time in <hi>Hungary;</hi> ſo that indeed the whole State of <hi>Europe</hi> being unwilling, or not in a condition to enter into a new War, it was greatly hoped that this would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige thoſe that ſtood out to a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: And the better to perfect an Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, a general Congreſs was held at the <hi>Hague,</hi> where it was thought ſomewhat reaſonable, that the True of Twenty years which the French King had offered ſhould be accepted, including the Allies on all parts; which coming to a Reſolve, and the Articles of Treaty agreed, amongſt other things, it was thought fit that the French King ſhould reſtore to the King of <hi>Spain, Dixmuyden,</hi> and <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray,</hi> with their Dependencies, having liberty to demoliſh the Fortifications; as likewiſe the other Places taken by force ſince the 30th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1683. and that in conſideration thereof, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould Surrender to him <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, Luxemburgh, Chimai</hi> and <hi>Bovines,</hi> with all their Dependencies; and to this purpoſe the Articles between the two Crowns were concluded on at <hi>Ratisbon.</hi> And now the French King being at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, began to grow exceeding trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56844:31"/>to his Proteſtant Subjects, having, during the former Tranſactions, put a very ſenſible Affront upon his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> for whilſt the Differences laſted between the French &amp; the Spaniards, they extremely waſted his Patrimony in <hi>Brabant, Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburgh,</hi> where the Prince of <hi>Iſenguyn,</hi> ſupported by the French Intereſt and Arms, had ſeized upon his Poſſeſſion of <hi>Warneſſon, Deſburgh, Vianden,</hi> St. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ith, Budgenback, &amp;c.</hi> yet out of a generoſity to his Country, in preferring their Peace and Tranquillity before his own intereſt, he forbore at that time to put in for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; nor could the Violences the French King unjuſtly offered in entring upon his Principality of <hi>Orange</hi> be leſs reſented, by which Act he ſeemed to have this farther deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> To hinder the Proteſtant Religion from flouriſhing there; for upon the Perſecution he raiſed in all parts of his own Territories, many of the Proteſtants ſent their Children to this Sovereign Principality to be Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Learning; but this greatly diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, he ſent his Orders to <hi>Monſieur Moran</hi> Super-intendent of <hi>Provence,</hi> to March a Body of 2000 Men thither, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of his Lieutenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56844:31"/>in <hi>Languedock,</hi> to command the Magiſtrates of the Principality of <hi>Orange</hi> to ſend away all the Children to their Parents, and not for the future to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any more into their Schools or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademies. To this unjuſt and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Demand they found themſelves conſtrained to conſent, promiſing to give notice to the Parents of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they might ſend for them home, hoping by this means they had given the King ſatisfaction: But what can ſatisfie an ambitious &amp; ſpightfull Mind? for although this gave the Citizens hope they were in Peace, yet it proved not ſo, for ſoon after Orders came to throw down the Walls of the City, and the French Dragoons Quartering upon the Inhabitants, committed many Indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Diſorders, compelling the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Work in ruining their own Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, which being undermined, were blown up.</p>
            <p>This News no ſooner came to his Highneſs's Council, but they complained of it to the States-General, as a breach of the laſt Peace, urging, that Reparation might be required for ſuch unjuſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt the Subjects of his Highneſs, in the midſt of a general
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56844:32"/>Peace: Nor were the States wanting in Writing to the King, and letting him know their Reſentments for ſo great an Injury, contrary to the Treaty of <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi> preſſing him for Reparation of the damage his Highneſs had, contrary to Articles, ſuſtained in the Violence done to his Subjects: But they could get no other Anſwer from the French Court, but that as for the Money extorted from the Inhabitants, thoſe that extorted it had no Order for it, and he had commanded Reſtitution to be made, and upon the Peoples ſubmitting to his Pleaſure, he had withdrawn his Forces, and reſtored the Inhabitants their Commerce accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Deſires; but as for the reſt, he alledged he had reaſon for what he did. This Anſwer, though it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generous, nor pleaſing, was all that could be got at that time, and ſo the matter continues to a more favourable opportunity.</p>
            <p>The Face of Peace now appearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Chriſtian Princes, and <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> being the greateſt Scene of War, the States thought of Disbanding their ſupernumerary Forces, and in order thereto adviſed with his Highneſs, who aſſured them that there was no Perſon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56844:32"/>more deſirous than himſelf to eaſe the People of their Contributions and Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; but in conſideration things were ſcarcely ſettled, and that the nighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Countries had not yet Disbanded, but were in Arms, he thought it the ſafeſt way to continue them till they might be aſſuredly free from the fear or ſuſpicion of any ſiniſter event, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And according to this prudent and grave Counſel they were continued, it being reſolved by the States-General, That the Extraordinary Forces ſhould be kept up to a farther time. And now his Highneſs being more at leiſure, and deſirous to promote the good of his Country, betook himſelf to the reforming the Government of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treicht,</hi> in which, during the Series of ſo tedious a War, ſome Diſorders and Irregularities had happened; which he redreſſed by prudently altering ſuch of the Magiſtracy as were looked upon unfit Perſons to manage the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and put ſuch into their places as he found better capable of managing ſo weighty a Truſt; ſtriving to promote and advance the welfare of the People at no ſmall expence of Pains and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, contrary to the Methods of the French King, who was then Dragooning
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56844:33"/>his Subjects of the Proteſtant Religion, and uſing all manner of ways to ruine them by Tortures, Confiſcations, and Impriſonments, and many ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian-like Proceedings.</p>
            <p>And ſince we are come to this part, pardon the Digreſſion, if I conceive it not amiſs to expoſe the Methods <hi>France</hi> has of late years taken to bring over Proteſtants to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Reader may the better diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the Actions of a vertuous Prince, who makes it his utmoſt care and ſtudy to preſerve and promote thoſe that are under his Juriſdiction, and a Prince that labours to ruine and deſtroy his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble you with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration put out againſt the Proteſtants in the year 1669. or hardſhips they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered before and ſince that year in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, till I come to the year 1680. In this year the King iſſued out his Order, thereby depriving them in general of all manner of places of Truſt, Offices, and Services; reducing the meaner ſort thereby to great diſtreſs, and diſanulling the more wealthy of what they had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with their Money, and the price of their Bloud: And the next year 1681,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56844:33"/>by a Decree of their Council, all Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Attornies, Solicitors, and Sergeants, which made profeſſion of the Reformed Religion, were rendred uncapable of their Employments; and the next year the Lords and Gentlemen were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to diſcharge their Proteſtant Officers and Servants; and in Eighty three, all Officers of the King's Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and thoſe of the Princes of the Bloud, were commanded to give place to the Roman Catholicks; and in a word, all manner of Perſons of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, that were of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, had a Prohibition by thoſe ſtrict Decrees under ſevere Penalties: And ſo ſtrict were they, that the Midwives, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Roman Catholicks, durſt not, but by ſtealth, perform their Office, and by this means, ſome were conſtrained to ſuffer their Tongue to give their Heart the Lye. Theſe, for the encouragement as they pretended of themſelves and others, being called new Converts, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the Payment of their Debts for the ſpace of three years, and this was done the better to diſappoint their Creditors of the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with whom they had moſtly dealt: Nor content with this, by another way
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56844:34"/>they quite diſcharged them of ſuch Debts as thoſe of that Religion had contracted in common.</p>
            <p>Theſe Proceedings ſerved only as a Prologue to that which was afterward acted on the Unchriſtian-like Stage of <hi>France;</hi> for the Councils, influenced by the Prieſts, who aimed more at the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the Proteſtants than their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, finding theſe ways not ſo effectual as they expected; and perceiving that many of the more wealthy made over their Eſtates, and left the Country, exhibited a Prohibition of ſelling, or alienating any Eſtates whatſoever, the King annulling and breaking all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and other Acts, relating to ſuch Sale or Alienation, if it did not appear that after any ſuch Act they did not ſtay in the Kingdom a whole year; ſo that being deprived of all means to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their effects, and yet not ſuffered to enjoy them with any quiet, many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring a good Conſcience before world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Riches, propoſed to leave all they had, and with it the Kingdom; but this took no effect; for hereupon they were forbidden it under ſevere Penalties, which drove them to ſo great a ſtrait, that they knew not what offer or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56844:34"/>to make, finding every thing hazardous and uncertain: But they were not long without new Proofs of Roman Severity; for though they had already fleeced them, yet not ſo contented, the Intendents in their Diſtricts had orders to weigh them down, if poſſible, with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Taxes, by charging them with thoſe of the new Converts, who were diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from paying any, in favour of their pretended Converſion, or by laying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on them, which they termed Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ſo that he who was before aſſeſſed in the Roll for 40 or 50 Livres, eſcaped well, if he came off for 5 or 600, and thoſe that delayed, or had not the Money, were obliged to quarter Dragoons, and ſuffer Impriſonment till they had made payment. And to paſs over many things of the like Nature, though the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants neglected nothing, either by way of Supplication, or endeavouring to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie their Rights, and manifeſt the wrong done them before the Judges in the reſpective Provinces; it was but like Water thrown upon lce, the more to harden it: But the Prieſts fearing this manner of Submiſſion might mollifie the King, who is not over much given to relent, they uſed all their Intereſts to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56844:35"/>puſh him on to a violenter motion; ſo that the Papiſts gave out, he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to ſuffer any <hi>Hugonots</hi> (ſo they called the Proteſtants) to live in the Kingdom; nor, like <hi>Pharoah,</hi> would he ſuffer them at the ſame time to depart.</p>
            <p>The Project by this time being grown ripe for Cruelty, they began with <hi>Bearn,</hi> where the Dragoons, committed their firſt Ravages, and after that, in High and Low <hi>Guinne, Xantoigne, Poictou,</hi> High <hi>Languedock Vivarets,</hi> and <hi>Dauphin,</hi> with ſome other places in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and after that in <hi>Lionois,</hi> Low <hi>Languedock, Gevennes, Valees, Provence,</hi> and the Countries of <hi>Geix,</hi> and then in <hi>Normandy, Bougoigne, Nivernois, Berry,</hi> and the Countries of <hi>Orleance, Tourain, Anjou, Bretaign, Champaign, Piccardy,</hi> the Iſles of <hi>France,</hi> and even in <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf, and in all Parts where any of the Reformed Religion had Habitations, or were fled for ſhelter; and the firſt thing the Intendents were ordered to doe, was to Summon the Cities and Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who were to aſſemble the Inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the reſpective Places, profeſſing the Proteſtant Religion, and let them know it was the King's Pleaſure they ſhould turn Roman Catholicks, or they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56844:35"/>ſhould be forc'd to doe it; at which the poor people greatly ſurprized, in an humble manner replyed, They were ready to ſacrifice their Lives and Eſtates to the Service of the King, but their Conſciences being Gods' alone, they could not in that manner diſpoſe of them.</p>
            <p>Upon Refuſal, the Dragoons who were at hand, were immediately ſent for, who in a furious manner ſeizing the Gates and Avenues of the Cities and Villages, guarding the Paſſes that none might eſcape, they often came with their Swords in their hands, crying <hi>Kill, kill, or elſe be Catholicks;</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they came, like the Locuſt, they devoured every good thing, being Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon the Proteſtants at diſcretion, with a Charge not to ſuffer them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of their Houſes, or conceal any of their Goods, under great Penalties to the Papiſts that ſhould receive or comfort them; and having eaten up their Proviſions, and plundred all that was of value, which they ſold to the nighbouring Catholicks, they in an inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane manner fell upon their Perſons: And now prepare to hear what even the Turks may bluſh to own.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:56844:36"/>
            <p>After many Revilings, Curſes, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations, they proceeded to hang up Men and Women by the Hair, or Feet, on the Roofs of Chambers or Chimney holes, where putting Wiſps of wet Hay on the Fire under them, they ſmoaked them till they were almoſt ſuffocated; and when they had taken them down, if they would not ſign to an Abjuration they hung them up again, or toſſed them to and fro into great Fires till they were in a manner roaſted: Under the Arms of ſome they tied Ropes, and plunged them in Wells till they were half drowned, ſwearing to finiſh their Lives there, unleſs they would promiſe to change their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Others they bound like Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, when putting to them the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they placed Funnels in their Mouths, and pouted Wine down their Throats, till having deprived them of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they obliged them to ſay they would be Catholicks: Some again they ſtripp'd naked, and pricked with Pins and Bodkins, till they were no longer able to endure it: Others they led about by the Noſes with Pincers, and wounded them with Pen knives: They beat ſome with Staves and dragged them, after much cruel uſage, to the Churches,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56844:36"/>where they conſtrued their being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, though againſt their Wills, for an Abjuration: Some again they kept wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, by toſſing them from one Soldier to another, and throwing Buckets of Water in their Faces for many Nights and Days; and the better to put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a diſorder and confuſion, clapped Kettles and Braſs Pans upon their heads, whereon they made a continual noiſe with the Hilts of their Swords, till they had in a manner made the Party diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And where they found any ſick or languiſhing, thither they brought Drums and Trumpets into the Chambers, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb and torment them from taking reſt; nor did they in ſome Places for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to bind the Fathers and Husbands, whilſt they forced and raviſhed their Wives and Daughters before their faces: Of ſome they plucked off the Nails, of others burnt the Feet, and blew with Bellows into the Fundaments of others, till they were ready to burſt; with many other Cruelties that Hell could inſpire, or witty horrour invent, And if by all theſe Strategems they could not work upon them to abjure their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the Profeſſion of the true Faith, then had they noiſome Dungeons prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56844:37"/>to impriſon them in, where many of them languiſhed to Death; nor did the Rage againſt their Perſons ſuffice, for they demoliſhed their Houſes, cut down their Woods, ſpoiled their pleaſant Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and Ortyards, ſeized their Children, and thruſt them into Monaſteries, and put them to be brought up under the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of Prieſts, and fold whatever was ſaleable; and for thoſe they found had eſcaped them, they hunted in the Woods as for wild Beaſts, miſerably uſing ſuch as fell into their hands.</p>
            <p>In theſe cruel Proceedings of the French Papiſts to their own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, there was a <hi>Decorum</hi> uſed; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Leaders and Military Officers, at the head of theſe Tormenters mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Intendents, and the Biſhops, every one in his Dioceſe; as alſo a Troup of Miſſionary Monks and Friars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as for the Intendents they gave ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as they thought moſt expedient for the carrying on of the hopefull Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to reſtrain natural Pity and Compaſſion, if at any time, which was but rare, it found place in the Hearts of the Dragoons, or their Commanders: The Biſhops were to take the Abjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to make a ſevere inſpection,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56844:37"/>that it ſhould be done in all points ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mind and intention of the Clergy, and the Miſſionaries were to be aſſiſting, in forcing the Abjuration. And when by this means they had forced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to an outward compliance, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the ſorrow of thoſe that perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſending them more Gueſts. Nor could the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſecure ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired thither, though Perſons of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Quality; for upon notice that ſeveral had fled the ſtorm, and were ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in that great City, leaving their Lands and Livings to the ſpoil and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock of the Soldiers, they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded within fifteen days to leave that Place, and retire to their Habitations by a Decree of the Council; and although they humbly beſought the King to ſtop the Courſe of Cruelty that raged againſt them, thoſe that attempted it had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Anſwer, than to be ſent Priſoners to the <hi>Baſtile;</hi> and to prevent ſuch as ſhould attempt to flie from their Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, the Provoſts had Orders to ſcowre the Roads, and the Magiſtrates to ſtop and ſend back ſuch as they found removing, without exception: Nor were there Informers wanting on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; and if the Husband had concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56844:38"/>his Wife or Children, he was tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted till he had brought them back again: Nor were ſome who pretended to be new Converts, though for the moſt part the Off-ſcums and Refuſe of Gaols, leſs active than the Renegadoes of <hi>Algier</hi> to add to the miſery of the ſuffering Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; nor would a bare ſigning the Abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſerve turn, for they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to go to Maſs receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and tell their Beads, having always Eyes over them; ſo that upon the leaſt Information of neglect they were ſeverely fined, or thrown into their former miſeries: Yet it pleaſed the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, that notwithſtanding the Sea-Ports were ſtopped and narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watched, many of them got off and were kindly received in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and plentifully relieved, ſettling ſuch as were capable of it in Buſineſs and Employments: But upon notice of theſe Eſcapes, the Forreign Veſſels in the Ports were ordered to be ſearched and none to embark or be carried off without he or ſhe produced a Certificate from the Biſhop or Curate, to certifie him or her a Roman Catholick; and ſeveral who attempted to eſcape were ſeized and impriſoned as Traitors.</p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:56844:38"/>
            <p>The ſtorm, as to its fury, being a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle moderate amongſt the Laity, by reaſon there was no great matters of Plunder to be had, they reſolved at laſt to begin with the Miniſters, who had been hitherto pretty well ſecured in their Perſons, by the Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi> which allowed them limitary Congregations; but the Court being of opinion that ſo long as they remained in <hi>France</hi> their Authority would reſtrain the Proteſtants from changing their Religion, and leave them but ſlenderly aſſured of their new Converts, the greater part of which they well knew had done what they did by conſtraint; therefore in the firſt place they laboured to ſtifle their Writings, prohibiting all manner of Books that ſhould any ways inſtruct the Lay-Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, or were Written by their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: And although the French Clergy, to have it thought they were not the Promoters of the Perſecution, ſeemed unwilling to conſent to the Revocation of that Edict, yet it was ſoon after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, and another made, conſiſting of Twelve Articles. The firſt repeals and ſuppreſſes all former Edicts in all their Extent, and ordains that all the Reformed Churches or Chapels that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56844:39"/>are found in Kingdom ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed. The Second prohibits all ſorts of religious Aſſemblies, of what kind ſoever, out of the Roman Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. The Third forbids the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe to all Lords and Gentlemen of any Quality, under Penalties of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Puniſhment, and confiſcation of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. The Fourth baniſhes all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, enjoining them to depart with in fifteen days-after the publication of the Edict, under Penalty of being ſent to the Galleys. The Sixth promiſes Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences and Advantages to the Miniſters and their Widows that ſhould change their Religion. The Seventh and Eighth for bid inſtructing Children in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, and ordain, that thoſe who ſhall be henceforth Born and Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed ſhall be brought up in the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion; enjoining their Parents to ſend them to the Churches under a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of five hundred Livres as a fine. The Ninth allows four months time to ſuch Perſons as have departed the Kingdom to return, or upon failure, to have their Goods and Eſtates confiſcated. The Tenth forbids all thoſe of the Reformed Religion, together with their Wives
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56844:39"/>and Children, to depart, or to convey away their Effects, under pain of the Galleys for the Men, and confiſcation of Body and Goods for the Women. The Eleventh confirms a former Declaration to puniſh thoſe that Relapſe. The Twelfth declares, that as to the reſt of the Subjects of the Religion, they may remain in the Cities of his Kingdom, and Lands of his Obedience, there to continue their Commerce and enjoy their Eſtates, without trouble or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation, upon pretence of the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, on condition they have no Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies under pretext of Praying or exerciſing any religious Worſhip what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>The very day this Edict was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, ſo haſty were theſe Dragoon. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters, that they began to demoliſh the famous Church of <hi>Chreenton,</hi> the elder Miniſter belonging to it being comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to leave <hi>Paris</hi> within Twenty four hours, and with all convenient ſpeed depart the Kingdom; and thereupon he was committed to the Charge of one of the King's Foot men, with an expreſs Order not to part with him till he was out of the Confines of <hi>France;</hi> but his Colleagues had Forty eight hours given
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56844:40"/>them to leave the City, and were per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted to depart upon their Parole; and the reſt had the time limited, but with ſo many vexations, that none but Men of great firmneſs of mind could have born it; for they not only denied them all their Movables and Books, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their private Papers, under pretence that they knew not whether they were theirs, or belonged to the Conſiſtory; but what was more cruel, they refuſed their Fathers or Mothers, Brothers or Siſters, or any of their near Relations to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them, though many of them were aged and infirm, and muſt, unleſs ſupported by an extraordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, periſh, without their ſuccour and aſſiſtence: nor was this all, for they kept from them their Children above the Age of ſeven, and ſome, where they had a more peculiar ſpight againſt the Father, that were ſcarcely weaned; nor would they allow a Nurſe to the ſucking Children where the Mother's Milk was dried up, and ſhe incapable of giving them ſuſtenance of that kind; and although they had Paſports, yet were they ſtopped upon the Borders, in divers places, by the malice of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, under pretence they muſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56844:40"/>prove they were the ſame Perſons mentioned, and that there was no cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Proceſs, or Information charged againſt them, and juſtifie that they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away nothing belonging to their Congregations; and this they did upon no other pretence than to enſnare them by ſpinning out the limited time for their Departure; for the days being expired, though they themſelves were the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers, in plain terms they told them their time was relapſed, and there was no hopes of eſcaping the Galleys.</p>
            <p>But now the Ports, Ways, and Fords, and all Places throughout the Kingdom, were ſo ſtrictly guarded, and narrowly ſearched by the Officers of the Forts and Cuſtoms, Soldiers and Peaſants, that moſt of thoſe that endeavoured to eſcape, were ſeized, and hurried to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whereby the Gaols became thron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and crouded; nor had they the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of common Malefactours, but were thruſt into Dungeons, and noiſome places, their Friends not daring to viſit or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, by which means a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber periſhed through hunger, and other inconveniencies; and although the Twelfth Article promiſes to ſecure the Laity in their Properties, Poſſeſſions,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56844:41"/>and Callings, yet the French Papiſts have not forgot the Decree of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> wherein it is expreſſed, <hi>That no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks,</hi> as they call the Proteſtants, for the ſame cruelty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity continued with as great Rage and Fury, where there was any plunder to be had, or people of Note dwelling: In <hi>Picardy, Normandy, Le Berry, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne, Orleance, Neivernois, Beleſſois,</hi> and the Iſles of <hi>France,</hi> nay, in <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf, after the Edict was publiſhed, the Procurator-General, and ſome other Magiſtrates, ſent for the Heads of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Families, and declared to them, That it was the King's poſitive Will that they ſhould change their Religion, and that if they would not comply they ſhould be made to doe it; and ſo procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Letters under the Princes Seal, to baniſh the Elders of the Conſiſtory, and ſuch perſons as they found, or at leaſt conceived inflexible.</p>
            <p>One thing is remarkable, <hi>viz. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Saignelay,</hi> Secretary of State, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent for to his Houſe, under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers pretences; about 100 Merchants, and others, he cauſed the Doors to be ſhut upon them, and inſtead of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs they expected, preſented them
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56844:41"/>with an Abjuration, commanding them in the King's name to ſign it, declaring with a ſtern Countenance, they ſhould not ſtir out at the Door till they had done it: The purport of it was this, That they ſhould not only abjure the Hereſie of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and enter into the Catholick Church, but declare that they did it voluntarily, or without being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or compelled to it; and although they many ways excuſed it, yet being ſharply reprimanded, and terrified by his Threats, not being fore-warned of ſuch a danger, and doubting the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that might attend it, they at laſt, not voluntarily, but by conſtraint, ſigned that Abjuration: Nor by the power and influence of the Clergy, did the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates refrain to take away Children from their Parents, to bring up in their ſuperſtitious way of idolatrous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, frequently ſeparating the Man and Wife, where they could gain upon the one, or the other, to Apoſtatize. Nor did they ſpare to doe this in <hi>Orange,</hi> the ſovereign Principality of his Highneſs the Prince, where the French King, by Right, has no power, but taking away the Miniſters by force, committed them to Priſon; the Dragoons, as it has been already hinted, doing there miſchiefs
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56844:42"/>much in likeneſs as in other Places, as well to the people as to the Officers of his Highneſs, to whom that Principality belongs. And much in this nature the Calamity of the ſuffering Proteſtants continued in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> to the year 1685. Nor do they fail at this day to make good, as much as in them lies, what their Clergy threaten in their Paſtoral Letters, by making it their ſtudy to invent new manner of Torments, the Magiſtrates being ever ready to aſſiſt them in the Execution.</p>
            <p>I might go on with this melancholy Story to the ſwelling of a large Volume, and add to it the Cruelty of the Savoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards againſt the Proteſtants in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries under that Duke, whoſe Miſeries equal, if not exceed, that I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; as likewiſe in ſundry other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and indeed in all places where the Papiſts have power, but that the digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will ſeem too long; and therefore I only give the Reader a taſte of what has been ſerved up in full Banquets of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Revenge, thereby to let thoſe that are at this day un-informed, know what they muſt expect, if they come into the hands of ſuch as account it merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to deſtroy Hereticks, nor think it any Crime to break the moſt ſolemn
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56844:42"/>Oaths, and make void all Proteſtations and Engagements, when they ſuppoſe it advantageous to their Intereſt, or Church's Cauſe: And note by the way, that all of the Reformed Religion, who have ſeparated from the Traditions, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and Idolatrous Worſhip of <hi>Rome,</hi> paſs with them for no other. Theſe Proceedings however turned at laſt to the diſadvantage of the Perſecutors; for, though for a time it enriched them, yet the number of People that fled, or were ruined, occaſioned the decay of Trade and Commerce, ſo that thoſe Revenues that ſupplied the French King's Coffers, and enabled him to vex all <hi>Europe,</hi> by a tedious War being exhauſted, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he had taken <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> from the Spaniards, he found himſelf in a low condition; for money being the very ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of War, and his Subjects not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to lend, as appears by the Anſwer of the Bankers of <hi>Paris,</hi> when he ſent to them the laſt year for ſeveral Millions of Livres, <hi>viz</hi> That they humbly beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Excuſe, foraſmuch that if they ſo far weakened the Bank, they could not ſupport their Credit in anſwering the Bills that ſhould be drawn upon them; He then, I ſay, found that when
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56844:43"/>by ſuch unjuſt means he depopulated his Kingdom, he fought againſt himſelf: but to return.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> all this while highly diſapproved his Proceedings, and if in Arms he did not oppoſe them, it was not for want of Will; but rather that he on his part would keep the Peace inviolable, and rather bear, till a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opportunity, the affront and injury done him, in the wrong his Subjects of the Principality of <hi>Orange</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, than involve the States in a new War; which might have been juſtly excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſince the French were the Aggreſſors. But to come yet nearer to the purpoſe:</p>
            <p>Whilſt his Highneſs was diverting and repoſing himſelf from the Toils of War, which now ceaſed by the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ratifying of the Treaty with <hi>France,</hi> His Majeſty of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> II. after five or ſix days indiſpoſition, departed this Life at his Palace Royal of <hi>White-Hall</hi> on the 6th. of <hi>February,</hi> 1684. not only to the extraordinary Grief of his Subjects, but of all <hi>Europe,</hi> their Highneſſes more eſpecially bearing a ſuperlative part in the ſorrow the loſs of that good King occaſioned, whoſe Funeral was private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56844:43"/>ſolemnized on the 14th. of <hi>February</hi> towards the Evening in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's Chapell, where it was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Vault under the Eaſt-end of the South-Iſle; Service being ended, and the Officers of his Houſhold having broke their Staves, the Royal Style was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by another of the Kings at Arms, according to the Cuſtome: And thus ſet this great Monarch, who had been ſo uſefull and dear to the Intereſt of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> making way thereby for his Brother, who was immediately proclaimed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and accordingly was Crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> on the twenty third of <hi>April</hi> following, with much ſplendour and magnificence, as is uſual at the Royal Ceremonies of the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> &amp;c. and had the Condolement and Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, the one for the Death of King <hi>Charles,</hi> and the other for His Majeſty's Acceſſion to the Throne, not only from the States-General, but from moſt of the European Princes. And now the States of <hi>Holland</hi> being in frequent Conſults about the Affairs of that Republick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Adjournments his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> diverted himſelf in viſiting the Towns and Fortifications,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56844:44"/>and ſettling Military Affairs; and the better to remove the Melancholy the Death of the King his Uncle had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, recreated himſelf at his Country Palace; when in the mean while the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> going from <hi>Holland</hi> with an inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of Men, the former to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>England,</hi> and the latter <hi>Scotland,</hi> their Expeditions proved altogether ſucceſsleſs for being ſeverally routed, and taken by the King's Forces, they ſuffered Death, together with divers others of their Adherents and Abettors.</p>
            <p>In <hi>July,</hi> 1687. his Highneſs returning from <hi>Hounſtyrdyke</hi> to the <hi>Hague,</hi> he there gave Audience to ſeveral foreign Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and then parted thence to viſit the Gariſons of <hi>Maeſtricht, Boiſleduck,</hi> and others belonging to the States, and in his Return was met by Her Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at <hi>Loo,</hi> he having in his Progreſs gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven neceſſary Orders for the well gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſtrengthening of thoſe Places:</p>
            <p>In <hi>December</hi> the <hi>Marqueſs d' Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> Envoy extraordinary from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> had Audience of his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> but they adjour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the 7th. of <hi>January,</hi> great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations

Now the foreign Prieſts coming again into remembrance, and being looked upon as Enemies to the Common-wealth, notwithſtanding the interceſſion that had been made on their behalf, the Court of Juſtice at the <hi>Hague</hi> drew up a Decree, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to retire out of the Country, and never to return again, promiſing a Reward of 100 Ducatoons to any that ſhould make diſcovery, and ſettling a penalty of 600 Florins upon thoſe that ſhould harbour and conceal any of them, for the firſt time; 1200 for the ſecond; and corporal puniſhment for the third Offence; whereupon a great many of them fled into <hi>England,</hi> where indeed there was but too many before: And now the Spring coming on, the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> went to their Palace at <hi>Loo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England,</hi> for private Reaſons of State, being about this time deſirous to call home the Engliſh Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56844:45"/>in the Service of the States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the <hi>Marqueſs d' Albeville</hi> made it known immediately to their Lordſhips, but they not willing to part with thoſe Forces, he proceeded to put in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials, repreſenting not only his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Refuſal, but the danger of Officers and Soldiers might incurr; but the States having before-hand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded them, and liſted them under their own Command, as many as would enter themſelves, (which was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Part of them, as well Officers as Soldiers,) this buſineſs came to nothing; and although his Majeſty had ordered the Maſters and Captains of Ships and Veſſels, to give ſuch as would return free Paſſage, with promiſe of Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet not many came over.</p>
            <p>In <hi>May</hi> the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> was ſplendidly entertained by his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> at <hi>Hounſlaerdyke,</hi> and the next day his Highneſs accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him to <hi>Scheveling,</hi> where they went on Board a ſmall Veſſel that carried them to a Squadron of 17 Men of War, arrived from <hi>Schonevelt,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Vice-Admiral <hi>Allemond,</hi> who ſent upon their Approach two light Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, and a Shallop, to meet them,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56844:45"/>and were ſaluted with the Cannon of all the Ships; when having Dined on board the Vice-Admiral, they returned to <hi>Scheveling,</hi> and from thence his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Highneſs of <hi>Saxony</hi> went to viſit <hi>Delf, Rotterdam, Dort, Maeſtricht, Leige Aix,</hi> and <hi>Cologne,</hi> and ſo returned home by the way of <hi>Francfort;</hi> when in the mean while the <hi>Heer Van Dieſt</hi> acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the States, with the Death of the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi> a perſon moſt firm to the Proteſtant Intereſt, and whoſe Death was regretted by the Proteſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States, ſo that both the Prince and the States of <hi>Holland</hi> immediately nominated a fit perſon to go and make their Complement of Condolence to the preſent Elector. The next month the <hi>Marqueſs d' Albeville,</hi> acquainted the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> as alſo the States, with the News of the Queen of <hi>England</hi>'s being delivered of a Son, at their Royal Palace of St. <hi>James</hi>'s, on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 10th. of <hi>June;</hi> and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the News, by ſundry Expreſſes, was likewiſe made known to the King's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in all the Courts of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> who, at a vaſt Expence and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, proclaimed it, and the Conduits in <hi>London</hi> were commanded to run with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56844:46"/>Wine, and a Thankſgiving day was likewiſe held for the Queens ſafe Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; Congratulations were made, upon this occaſion, by all the Foreign Miniſters, and the Infant ſoon after or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be prayed for in the publick Prayers of the Church. Some Addreſſes were likewiſe preſented upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the Romaniſts flattered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a laſting Tranquillity; and ſo ſure they thought they were of gaining the point, that the Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Lord Biſhops of <hi>Ely, Peterborough,</hi> St. <hi>Aſaph, Chicheſter, Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and <hi>Briſtol</hi> (who had been committed by an Order of Council to the Tower, for humbly beſeeching his Majeſty by Petition to remit his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of enjoyning his Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience to be read in the Churches, in time of Divine Service) were brought to their Tryalls at the King's-Bench Court <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where, notwithſtanding all that was alledged againſt them, and the preſſing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Popiſh Judge, then upon the Bench, their Candour and Innocence ſo fairly and plainly appeared, that inſtead of their Adverſaries proving that Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Libel, it was evidently demonſtrated that they had done nothing but their</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56844:49"/>on the 16th. of <hi>September</hi> the States aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at the <hi>Hague,</hi> where his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was preſent, continuing in debating ſeveral matters of great weight and conſequence, but as to the particulars we are wanting; however it was generally ſuſpected that the King had Intelligence that the great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons of Naval and Land Forces were intended for <hi>England;</hi> when contrary to expectation, His Majeſty, in his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bearing Date the 20th. of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> relating to the Regulating Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, has this Clauſe, <hi>viz We are willing the Roman Catholicks ſhall remain incapable to be Members of the Houſe of Commons, &amp;c.</hi> and on the 26th. an Order was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reſtore the Deputy-Lieutenants, and ſuch Gentlemen as had been put out of their Offices, and Commiſſions; and the next publick account we had, was the King's Proclamation, bearing Date the 25th. of <hi>September,</hi> giving a large Account of his Highneſs's Intentions to paſs the Seas, and land in <hi>England,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>d' Albeville</hi> preſented a Memorial to the Deputies of the States-General upon that Subject, yet the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations went on, and whilſt the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs expected an Anſwer to his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56844:49"/>the Troups embarked, and her Highneſs, and the <hi>Mareſchal de Scomberg</hi> came to the <hi>Hague:</hi> And ſo far wrought the News of theſe preparations, that <hi>Magdalen</hi> College in <hi>Oxford</hi> was orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be reſtored and ſettled; ſettled; <hi>London</hi> was likewiſe reſtored her antient Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; other Corporations were reſtored to their Charters and Magiſtrates, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> had immediately the right hand of Fellowſhip, which made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wonder to ſee things ſo ſuddenly changed; the ſuffering Biſhops were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into favour, and had leave to make their propoſals for the good ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſtitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Popiſh Party that was ſo lately Paramount, began to droop; ſo wonderfully wrought the terrour of his Highneſs's Approach.</p>
            <p>On the 15th. of <hi>October,</hi> the Infant who had before been privately Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was publickly named, amidſt the Ceremonies and Rites of Baptiſm, in the Chapel at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, by the Name <hi>James Francis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Edward,</hi> the Pope being God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>father by his <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and the Queen <hi>Dowager</hi> God mother, the King and Queen, with many others, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting.

            <p>So by this it appears, that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had effectually 14352. perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his command, not accounting thoſe that came over Voluntiers; and theſe, paſt peradventure, rather increaſed than diminiſhed, during the Fleet, which by this Account conſiſted of 635. great and ſmall Ships and Veſſels, lying in the Roads, for ſome time after this Liſt was publiſhed. But to return again to <hi>Torbay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Highneſs having in good order landed the greateſt part of the Horſe and Foot, and given Directions for the ſpeedy landing the reſt, and the Cannon to be un-ſhipped, for the more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency at <hi>Topſham,</hi> he marched towards the City of <hi>Exeter,</hi> with the general Approbation, Shouts, and Applauſe of the People, who flocked from all parts to welcome him; and divers Gentlemen of thoſe parts came to wait upon him, and tender their ſervice upon his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, the Biſhop retired, and the Gates were cloſed, by Order of the Mayor, but without baracadoing or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening, ſo that being ſoon opened, an advanc'd party enter'd, and was joyfully received by the Inhabitants, a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them having before their coming,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56844:52"/>liſted themſelves for the ſervice of the Prince; and into this City his Highneſs entred with great Splendour the <hi>Friday</hi> after his landing, and took up his Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Biſhop's Palace; giving a ſtrict command to all the Officers and and Soldiers, that they ſhould behave themſelves orderly and civilly, to all manner of perſons, duly and diligently obſerving to defray their Quarters, and offering no manner of Injury nor Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, under ſevere Penalties, and ſuch Regiments as that City could not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were appointed other Stations.</p>
            <p>In this City, in a full Auditory, his Highneſs's firſt Declaration was read; ſhewing the Reaſons of his coming over, and inducing him to appear in Arms in the Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi> for the preſerving the Proteſtant Religion, and for the reſtoring the Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> ſetting forth, <hi>How they had been manifeſtly Violated by Evil Counſellours, and Miniſters of State, to the great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the people, and endangering the Subverſion of the Religion, and Establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Government of theſe Kingdoms, and to bring them under Popery and Slavery:</hi> With many other cogent and preſſing

            <p>The Prince continuing ſtill in the City of <hi>Exeter,</hi> gave neceſſary Orders for the Settlement of the Revenue of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56844:53"/>thoſe Parts, ariſing by Exciſe, and other Duties, where the King's Officers were at that time remiſs in their Attendence, ſome of them being Roman Catholicks, and fled, he appointed the Lord <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Row,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, for the more prudent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, and ſent out Parties to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Horſes for their Service; His Highneſs recreating himſelf at times, by taking a view of the Country, but his Army almoſt hourly increaſing, he commanded detached Parties to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and poſſeſs themſelves of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Poſts; and in the mean time we had News that the Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> came to <hi>Mancheſter</hi> with a ſtrong Party, and there declared for His Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and made a Speech to his Tenents, and others, deſiring them to meet him the next day at <hi>Bodon Downs,</hi> the intended Place of Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz; where accordingly he found a great appearance, who willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves to be diſpoſed under his Command: But the Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi> being on his way to join with the Prince, with a Party of Horſe, was ſurprized in his Inn at <hi>Cirenceſter</hi> by the Militia; and (after a ſtout reſiſtence, in which
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56844:54"/>the Major that commanded, together with his Son, and ſome others, were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,) his Lordſhip was taken Priſoner, and afterward carried to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> but was there reſcued by a Party of the Prince's Horſe.</p>
            <p>The King upon notice that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had left <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and was advancing with his own and the additional Forces that were come in, cauſed the Train of Artillery to be drawn out of the Tower, being before prepared on Carriages fit to March; and paſſing towards <hi>Salisbury,</hi> he prepared his Equipage to be at the Head of his Army, which was ordered to draw together about <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and accordingly ſetting out from <hi>White-Hall</hi> with no great Attendence, he arrived there the 19th. of <hi>November,</hi> about Four in the Evening, and was met by the Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Feverſbam,</hi> and other Commanders, on Horſe-back, a Mile from the Gates of the City, where he was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Mayor and Aldermen, in their Formalities, to the Biſhop's Palace, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for his Lodgings; and there perceiving an almoſt general falling off of the Nobility and Gentry, as well as the Forces under his Pay, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56844:54"/>Lords were up in the North, he iſſued out a Proclamation, bearing Date the 20th. of <hi>November,</hi> offering a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to all his Subjects that had taken up Arms under the Prince, if they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Twenty Days, and rendered themſelves to the Officers Military and Civil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things happened, a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Prince's Men being abroad, and advancing beyond their Strengths, were purſued and charged by <hi>Coll. Sarsfield,</hi> with 70 Horſe, and 30 Dragoons and Granadiers; and overtaking them at <hi>Wincanton,</hi> they poſted themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Hedges; upon which the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons and Granadiers were obliged to diſmount, and march up to the Hedges, ſo that they began to Fire very briskly on both ſides, and ſeveral were killed and wounded; but Collonel <hi>Sarsfield</hi> getting into the Field with his Horſe, and Charging them in the Rear, they were moſt of them killed and taken Priſoners. Amongſt the Slain was one <hi>Cambell,</hi> a Lieutenant, who commanded them; and on the King's Party four were killed, and <hi>Cornet Web</hi> mortally wounded.</p>

            <p>This ſlender Succeſs was clouded, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Notice that the Earl of <hi>Bath</hi> had Seized upon <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and made the Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> the Governour thereof, Priſoner; the whole Gariſon declaring for His Highneſs, upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Declarations; the Fleet like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe began to grow cold, and many of the Commanders began to declare for the Prince; ſo that the King not thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it convenient to hazard a Battel with an Army he could no ways enſure to his Intereſt, upon the near Approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Prince's Forces, (with whom were now a great part of the Nobility) he haſtily left <hi>Salisbury,</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off thoſe Forces he had there, and remanding the Train of Artillery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where he arrived on the 26th. of <hi>November,</hi> in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and appointed Collonel <hi>Beville Skelton</hi> Lieutenant of the Tower, in in the Place of Sir <hi>Edward Hales;</hi> and according to what had been deſired by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, in their Petition, gave Order to the Lord Chancellour, for Iſſuing out Writs for the Summoning a Parliament to ſit the 15th. day of the enſuing <hi>January,</hi> and Commiſſioners were nominated to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56844:55"/>treat with the Prince: A <hi>Proclamation</hi> was likewiſe publiſh'd to give timely notice to thoſe that were Electors, or would ſtand for Candidates: The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> was likewiſe nominated Lord Arch-Biſhop of the long vacant See of <hi>York,</hi> and did Homage to the King the day after the Ceremonies of his Tranſlation from the See of <hi>Exeter</hi> to the Archiepiſcopal See of <hi>York;</hi> which were performed at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> by his Grace the Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> aſſiſted by the Biſhops of St. <hi>Aſaph, Ely, Rocheſter,</hi> and <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things were doing, News came that the Lords in the North had ſeized upon <hi>York,</hi> and made the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Priſoner, declaring for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and diſarming all Papiſts of note, their Number and Power daily increaſing; ſo that the Lord <hi>Mollenax,</hi> who was up with a party for the King in thoſe Parts, found himſelf in no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to make any head; but ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was deſerted by moſt of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; and the ſtrong Gariſon of <hi>Hull</hi> was ſecured to the Intereſt of His Highneſs, by the Deputy Governour, and by the Aſſiſtence of the Soldiers of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56844:56"/>his Party, the Towns-men , and ſome Sea-men that were in the Port; the ſecuring it, according to the Relation, being on this manner.</p>
            <p>On the 3d. of <hi>December,</hi> about 9 of the Clock, the Guards being ſet, and the <hi>Tat-too</hi> over , the Deputy-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as it was his place, was preparing to go the Rounds, but the Lord <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> the Governour, told him he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and Major <hi>Fountain,</hi> to ſupply that Duty for the Night; whereupon ſome Words paſſing, the Deputy Governour made his Party, and drawing up the Soldiers in Battalia, ſiezed the Guards, and made the Lord <hi>Langdale,</hi> the Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and others, Priſoners; and at break of day a Party was ſent over the Bridge, to ſeize the Caſtle, and Block-Houſes, with the new Citadel; ſo that the Inhabitants and Sea-men concurring with the Soldiers, that ſtrong Place was entirely ſecured, and the Maſs-Houſe demoliſhed with great joy, and ringing of Bells, and the Prince's Colours were placed upon the high Church; the Papiſts that had come thither for ſhelter were turned out, and the Governour diſmiſſed, and guarded a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56844:56"/>part of the way to his Houſe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the danger that threatened him from the Mobile, who began to be very inſolent. Divers other places declared likewiſe for the Prince; and the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> who had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the County Militia, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving he could not in that kind advantage the King's Affairs, which were now grown deſperate, betook himſelf to his Retirement; ſo that the Militia found themſelves disbanded.</p>
            <p>The Noblemen who were ſent to treat with his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> about accommodating the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Kingdom, not being able to effect in all points what the King deſired, the Infant, which had been ſent to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> either as ſuppoſed the ſecureſt place, or to paſs the Seas, was ſent for back in great haſte; and the Prieſts began to ſhift for themſelves, Father <hi>Petre</hi> was miſſing, with divers others, who it is ſuppoſed, perceiving the deſperateneſs of their condition, made an early eſcape; and ſeveral Councils were held, moſt of them pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately in the King's Cloſet, to adviſe what was to he done in the Juncture of affairs; when on the 9th. of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:56844:57"/>in the Evening, News came that greatly allarm'd the Court, and put it for the moſt part in a hurry and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, <hi>viz. That the Prince's Forces had made their way through</hi> Reading, <hi>and gained the Paſs of</hi> Twyford-bridge, <hi>without any conſiderable reſiſtence:</hi> And thus we find the account of this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>About 1500 Horſe, and 3 Troups of Iriſh Dragoons being quartered, or poſted in the Town of <hi>Reading,</hi> were put into a Conſternation upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that a ſtrong advanced Party of the Prince's Army were on their march to beat up their Quarters; ſo that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome Conſultation of the Officers, it was concluded they ſhould draw off to <hi>Twyford</hi>-Bridge, and there make good their Poſt, which accordingly they did; but the Scouts that were ſent abroad to diſcover, coming in, and giving them an account that the Roads were clear, the Commander in chief commanded that <hi>Claverhouſe</hi> Regiment of Scotch Horſe, and the Iriſh Dragoons, ſhould march back, and repoſſeſs the Town of <hi>Reading,</hi> which they did on the Eighth of <hi>December</hi> at Night, with Orders to be in readineſs, and upon their Guards
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56844:57"/>to prevent ſurprize; ſo that moſt of them kept on Horſe-back, ſome in the Market-place, and others at the Poſts aſſigned them; but there being yet no news of the advanc'd Party, they were commanded by their Officers to alight, and refreſh themſelves and their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; when at ten of the Clock in the Morning, the Trumpet ſounded to Horſe, the Prince's Forces being at the Town's end, almoſt before they were diſcovered, whereupon a ſharp diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute enſued, with brisk Firing on both Parties; the Iriſh Dragoons bearing the brunt of the Encounter, though the Scotch Horſe in ſmall detatched Bodies made ſome Firings; but they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered, driven out of the Town, and obliged to retreat to <hi>Twyford</hi>-Bridge; and in concluſion, many of the King's Party Deſerted, and the reſt were conſtrained to quit the Paſs, and make the beſt of their Retreat. In this Skirmiſh we cannot learn that above Thirty were killed, and ſeveral woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But now the King having no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Forces, eſpecially none capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of making Head againſt a prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Army; the Queen, who had been at <hi>Wind for</hi> the day before, to fetch the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56844:58"/>Infant, taking her ſolemn leave of the King, croſſed the <hi>Thames</hi> on the Tenth of <hi>December,</hi> about Three in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, where her Coaches waited for her; and ſo with the Child, and a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Attendence, made for <hi>Dover,</hi> or ſome Port near it, and there took Shipping for <hi>France,</hi> where ſhe ſoon after landed, and had a place of Reſidence appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her by the French King.</p>
            <p>The Queen having left <hi>White-Hall,</hi> as alſo a great many of the Courtiers, the King the ſame Evening called an extraordinary Council; and ſent for the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and the Sheriffs; who waiting upon His Majeſty, were, amongſt other things, charged to have a Care of the City, and keep it in Peace and Quietneſs, as much as in them lay, and then were diſmiſſed: However, the Council held a long De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and a meeting was appointed the, the next Morning; but, contrary to the Expectation of almoſt the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the King, about Three a Clock in the Night, took Barge at the <hi>Privy Stairs,</hi> with a ſmall Equipage; and went down the River on his Departure, without giving notice to any of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his Houſhold, who were then in</p>

            <p>The King's Departure, was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſpread abroad, but the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal that were about Town aſſembled; and finding <hi>White-Hall</hi> full of Conſternation, after ſome Debates, they gave order for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing Popiſh Officers and Soldiers; and giving Directions for the keeping of that Palace from Pillage or Spoil, which in that Confuſion might have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they adjourned immediately to the <hi>Guild Hall</hi> of the City of <hi>London,</hi> where, by their Order, the Lord Mayor had ſummoned the Court of Aldermen, and thither they ſent for Collonel <hi>Bevil Skel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower;</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him, to reſign up that important Citadel to the Lord <hi>Lucas,</hi> in truſt of the City, till other Meaſures could be taken; and proceeded to approve and ſign the following Declaration, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>We doubt not, but the World believes, that in this great and dangerous Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture We are Heartily and Zealouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the Proteſtant Religion, the Laws of the Land, and the Liberties and Properties of the Subject; and we did reaſonably hope, that the King having Iſſued out his Proclamation and Writs for a Free
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56844:59"/>Parliament, We might have reſted ſecure under the Expectation of that Meeting; but His Majeſty having withdrawn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and as we apprehend, in order to his Departure out of the Kingdom, by the pernicious Counſels of Perſon, ill-affected to our Nation, and Religion, We cannot, without being wanting to our Duty, be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent under the Calamities wherein the Popiſh Counſels, which ſo long prevailed, have miſerably involved us: We do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unanimouſly reſolve to apply our ſelves to his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who with ſo great Kindneſs to theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, ſo Vaſt Expence and ſo much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to his own Perſon, hath undertaken (by endeavouring to procure a Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to reſcue us, with as little Effuſion of Chriſtian Blood as poſſible, from immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Dangers of Popery and Slavery.</p>
               <p>And, we do hereby declare, That we will with our utmoſt Endeavours aſſiſt his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the obtaining ſuch a Parliament, with all ſpeed, wherein our Laws, our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and our Proſperities may be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; the Church of England in particular, with a due.

               <p>In the mean time we will endeavour to preſerve, as much as in us lies, the Peace and Security of theſe great and populous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the parts adjacent, by taking Care to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm all Papiſts, and ſecure all Jeſuits, and Romiſh Prieſts, who are in or about the ſame; and if there be any thing more to be performed by us; for the promoting His Highneſs's Generous Intentions for the publick Good, we ſhall he ready to doe it as Occaſion ſhall require.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This was ſigned by the two Arch-Biſhops, five Biſhops, and Twenty two Noblemen; and it was there concluded, that the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> the Lord Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Weymouth,</hi> the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Culpepper,</hi> ſhould forthwith attend his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> with the ſaid Declaration; and at the ſame time acquaint him with what was farther done at that Meeting.</p>

            <p>The Lords having left the <hi>Guild Hall,</hi> the Lord Mayor, Court of Aldermen, and the Common Council aſſembled, and amongſt other Matters it was agreed by Vote, that an Humble Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs ſhould in their Names, and on the behalf of the City, be preſented to His Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange, In haec verba.</hi>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Highneſs,</p>
               <p>WE taking into Conſideration Your Highneſs's fervent Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, manifeſted to the World in your many and hazardous Enterpriſes; which it hath pleaſed Almighty God to bleſs you with miraculous ſucceſs, we render our deepeſt thanks to the Divine Majeſty for the ſame, and beg leave to preſent our humble thanks to your Highneſs particularly, for your appearing in Arms in this Kingdom; to carry on, and perfect your glorious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to reſcue <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> from Popery and Slavery; and in a Free Parliament to eſtabliſh the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the Laws, and Liberties of theſe Kingdoms upon a ſure and laſting Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>

            <p>This Addreſs being highly approved by all preſent, Four Aldermen, and Eight Commoners were appointed to wait upon his Highneſs, and preſent him with the ſaid Addreſs; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly it was preſented, and very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably received.</p>
            <p>And the Lieutenancy of the City of <hi>London,</hi> being the ſame day aſſembled, drew up an Addreſs to be preſented to his Highneſs, on the behalf of themſelves, the Militia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being to the ſame Effect with the former, we think it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to inſert.</p>

            <p>This Addreſs was delivered by four of the Members of the Lieutenancy, and very kindly received by his Highneſs.

                     <hi>HAving received this Morning a Letter from His Majeſty, with the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate News of his Reſolution to go out of</hi> England, <hi>and that he is actually gone, I thought my ſelf obliged, being at the Head of his Army, having received his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Orders to make no oppoſition againſt any Body, to let your Highneſs know (with the Advice of the Officers here) ſo ſoon as it was poſſible, to hinder the Misfortune of Effuſion of Bloud: I have ordered already, to that purpoſe, all the Troups that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Command, which ſhall be the laſt Order they ſhall receive from me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <pb n="113" facs="tcp:56844:61"/>
            <p>This Order cauſed the Troups to fall off and disband, as well becauſe they knew themſelves without a Head, as not knowing how to come by their Pay, if they continued in the Service; and indeed many of the Foot Soldiers were driven to great extremity; being by this Disbanding deſtitute of Moneys, Lodging, and other necceſſaries, and had for a while nothing to ſubſiſt, but the Charity of the People: And although the Iriſh Battalion ſeemed for a time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate to continue in Arms, yet the Commands they received from His Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the neceſſity that they felt, conſtrained them to ſubmit.</p>
            <p>This Diſperſing of the Solders, made his Highneſs publiſh a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, requiring all Commanders in chief, by Beat of Drum, or otherwiſe, to call together the ſeveral Officers and Soldiers, belonging to their reſpective Regiments, Troups, and Companies, in ſuch places as they ſhould find moſt convenient for their Rendezvouz; and there to keep them in good Order and Diſcipline.

            <p>Whilſt theſe things paſſed in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the multitude got together in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, ſpoiling and demoliſhing the Popiſh Maſs-Houſes, and Chapels; much defacing the Dwelling Houſes of ſeveral Eminent Papiſts, who were fled for fear of being ſecured; and though the Magiſtrates laboured to quiet the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Diſorders of this kind, yet they found their Authority too feeble, till the Mobile had ſpent their rage in <hi>London, &amp;c.</hi> They pull'd down the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of Monks in St. <hi>John's,</hi> which had been two Years Building at a vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and Burnt the greateſt part of the Timber and Materials in <hi>Smithfield;</hi> having before ſiezed ſome of the Goods, as they were removing them, and burnt them in <hi>Holborn:</hi> They likewiſe defaced and demoliſhed the Chapels in <hi>Lime-ſtrect</hi> and <hi>Lincolns-Inn Fields,</hi> with that of the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour's at <hi>Wild-houſe,</hi> where violently breaking into his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency's Lodgings, they got great ſtore of Plunder, in Plate, Money, and ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>On the 4th. of <hi>December,</hi> His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> came to <hi>Windſor</hi> about Three in the Afternoon, and was received with moſt profound reſpect and ſubmiſſion by the Mayor and Aldermen in their Formalities, the Steward of that Corporation Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating his Arrival in a moſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Speech; and afterwards he went to the Prince of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Lodgings, prepared for his Reception: And whilſt His Highneſs was preparing for <hi>London,</hi> News came that the King attempting to paſs the Seas at <hi>Feverſham</hi> in diſguiſe, was ſtay'd by ſome of the Towns-men who were fearching for ſuch as were endeavouring the like, who being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that it was his Majeſty, carried him in a rude manner to a houſe in the Town; taking from him ſome Jewels, conſiderable quantity of Gold, and his Crucifix of a great Value: Not did thoſe rude People deſiſt from their Incivilities, till a Gentleman coming to ſee the Priſoners they had taken, and knowing the King, fell on his Knees to pay him duty; whereat the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude being ſtrangely ſurprized, a great
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56844:63"/>part of them retired, and others begged his Majeſties Pardon, offering to reſtore what they had taken from him; but he would not receive his Gold again, but gave it them in Generoſity, as a free Gift.</p>
            <p>The Lords at <hi>White-Hall</hi> hearing of his Majeſty's being at <hi>Feverſham,</hi> ſent to wait upon him, and pray him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Palace Royal; to which he ſeemed not at firſt inclinable; though being preſſed to a Return, he at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. But His Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> having fully determined to come to <hi>London</hi> with all ſpeed, he thought it in many reſpects improper for the King and himſelf to be there at one and the ſame time in the preſent State of Affairs; upon notice his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was returning, he ſent Monſieur <hi>Zuleſtein</hi> to meet him on the way, and intreat him to return to <hi>Rocheſter;</hi> but Monſieur <hi>Zuleſtein</hi> miſſing him by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king another Road than that by which he came, the King arrived at <hi>White-hall</hi> the 16th. of <hi>December</hi> in the Evening, attended by divers Noblemen, and a Guard of Horſe; and from thence he ſent the Lord <hi>Feverſham</hi> to invite his Highneſs to come to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56844:64"/>take that Palace as his Place of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, with what number of Troups he thought convenient.</p>
            <p>The Prince deliberating upon this, with the Lords at <hi>Windſor,</hi> the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had appointed to be in Town; and having communicated to them the Meſſage, and left them to debate the matter; it was agreed that it was in no kind adviſable, for the Prince to accept the Invitation; and there being on the other ſide a neceſſity the Prince ſhould be in Town, the next day the Lords thought the ſhortneſs of time could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no better Expedient, than that the King might be deſired to remove to ſome Place within a reaſonable diſtance from <hi>London;</hi> upon which <hi>Ham,</hi> a Houſe belonging to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Lander-dale,</hi> was concluded on; and in order to this, a Paper was drawn, and Signed by the Prince, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>This Letter was ſigned by three Lords, and the Lord <hi>Middleton</hi> ſent back word by the Meſſenger, he would be ready at the Stairs of the Guard-Chamber, to carry the Lords to the King, where accordingly they found his Lordſhip, and he brought them to the King, whom they found in Bed; and after having made an Apology for coming at a time that might diſturb him, the Prince's Meſſage, before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, was delivered to him, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had read, he ſaid he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it; the Lords, as they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, humbly deſired, that if it might
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56844:65"/>be done with conveniency to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, that he would be pleaſed to remove ſo early, as to be at <hi>Ham</hi> by Noon, to prevent by that means, his meeting the Prince, in his way to <hi>London:</hi> To this the King readily agreed, and afterwards asked if he might not appoint what Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhould attend him, to which the Lords replied, it was left to His Majeſty to give Order in that as he pleaſed. And after the Lords had taken their leave, and were gone as far as the Privy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the King ſent for them again, and told them that he had forgot to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with his Reſolution before the Meſſage came, to ſend the Lord <hi>Godolphin</hi> the next Morning to the Prince, to propoſe his going back to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> he finding, by the Meſſage, Monſieur <hi>Zuleſtein</hi> was charged with, that the Prince had no mind he ſhould be at <hi>London;</hi> and therefore he now deſired that he might rather return to <hi>Rocheſter:</hi> the Lords replied, that they would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſend an account to the Prince; of what His Majeſty deſired, and did not doubt of ſuch an Anſwer as would be to his ſatisfaction; and accordingly they immediately diſpatched back again a Meſſenger, who finding the Prince at

               <hi>Sion,</hi> gave him an account of all that had paſſed, and before Eight of the Clock in the morning, had a Letter from the Sieur <hi>Benting,</hi> by the Prince's Order, agreeing to the King's Propoſal of going to <hi>Rocheſter;</hi> and accordingly the Guards and Barges being made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to attend him, his Coach and Sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appointed likewiſe to follow him, he reached <hi>Graveſend</hi> on the 18th. in the Evening, and paſſed over Land in his Coach, attended by ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where His Majeſty was pleaſed to chuſe the Houſe of Sir <hi>Richard Head,</hi> for the place of his Reſidence at that time.</p>
            <p>One thing there was remarkable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King's firſt with-drawing himſelf and his return, which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring people are apt to conclude might be deſigned for a general Notice for the Papiſts to have riſen in Arms, and fell upon the Proteſtants in their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, had not his Highneſs's Prudent Conduct broken their Meaſures, and rendred their Purpoſe inſignificant, and that was a general Allarm, given in the dead of the Night, at almoſt one and the ſame time, in the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Cities and Towns in <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:56844:66"/>upon pretence the Iriſh were killing, burning, and deſtroying all before them, which appeared to be carried on induſtriouſly, by perſons ſet on purpoſe to ſpread that falſe Allarm, or it could not other ways have been done in ſo many diſtant places at once, which put people into a great Hurry and Conſternation, till day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and convinced them of the Fallacy; ſo that whatever was intended, God prevented its taking effect.

            <p>Upon the Arrival of His Highneſs, the Common Council of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> aſſembled, and unanimouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed and ordered, <hi>That all the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that City, and their Deputies, with two Common Council Men for each Ward, ſhould wait upon, and congratulate His Highneſs, upon his happy Arrival at ſuch a time and place as his Highneſs ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point; and that the two Sheriffs, and Mr. Common Serjeant ſhould wait upon him to know his pleaſure when he would be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by that Committee;</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the next day they attended His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at St. <hi>James</hi>'s; and on the 20th. the Lord Mayor being indiſpoſed, the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and their reſpective Deputies, with ſome of the Common Council-men of each Ward, waited on the Prince to congratulate him on his happy Arrival; which was performed by Sir <hi>George Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> in a Florid Speech.</p>
            <p>The High Sheriff, Nobility, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the County of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> about this time drew up and ſigned an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to his Highneſs; wherein they not only beg his Protection, and implore his aid to reſtore theſe Kingdoms from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Slavery; but alſo aſſure his Highneſs, that they will contribute their

And now the King's Forces that were disbanded, not having any certain Stations, or places of gathering, Quarters were appointed the reſpective Troups and Regiments, whither the Officers and Soldiers, were commanded forth-with to repair; and ſeeing many had embezzled their Arms, and Order was put forth, ſigned by his Highneſs, commanding thoſe that had them in cuſtody, to re-deliver them to the Soldiers, the Officers of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or common Stores of the <hi>Tower,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Upon which, they immediately agreed to go to the Commons Houſe at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> where being ſate, they choſe <hi>Henry Powle</hi>

               <hi>Returning his Highneſs their hearty and unfeigned Thanks, and expreſſing their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary acknowledgement of the care he

            </p>
            <p>On the 28th. of <hi>December</hi> in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Lords attended his Highneſs at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, who gave them this anſwer:</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Have conſidered of your Advice, and as far as I am able I will endeavour to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Peace of the Nation untill the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Convention in <hi>January</hi> next; for the Election whereof I will forthwith iſſue out Letters, according to your Deſire; I will alſo take care to apply the publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues to the moſt proper uſes that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Affairs do require; and likewiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to put <hi>Ireland</hi> into ſuch a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Proteſtant Religion, and the Engliſh Intereſt may be maintained in that

            </q>
            <p>The Lords having made their Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acknowledgment for this Speech ſo ſuitable to their Deſires, the Gentlemen who had ſerved as Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment during the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. together with the Aldermen and Common-Council of the City of <hi>London,</hi> waited upon him in the Afternoon, to whom his Highneſs was pleaſed to give the ſame anſwer.</p>
            <p>Nor was there only a Pleaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in <hi>England,</hi> for His Highneſs's Succeſs, and proſperous Proceedings; but on the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> (New-Style) all the Perſons of Quality that were at the <hi>Hague</hi> appeared at Court, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement her Royal Highneſs the Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> and in the Evening their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectoral Highneſſes of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there, and were conducted to the old Palace, which was prepared for them, whither her Royal Highneſs went to viſit the Electoreſs, and ſplendid En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56844:70"/>were made upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>On the 30th. of <hi>December</hi> His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was pleaſed to iſſue out his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for authorizing Sheriffs, Juſtices of the Peace, and other Officers and Miniſters, to Act in their reſpective Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that were in Office the firſt of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> Papiſts excepted, with a Charge to be carefull and diligent in their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Truſts, for preſerving the Peace and Quiet of the Kingdom, and relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the Country People and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſcouting abroad, had gleaned a great number of Perſons, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Safety had cauſed their with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, amongſt whom was the Earls of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and <hi>Peterborough, Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Hales,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Jenner, Charles Hales,</hi> Dr. <hi>Obadiah Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Richard Graham, Philip Burton,</hi> and many others, as alſo nine Jeſuites, <hi>viz.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56844:71"/>the Elections were carried on in moſt Places, as it were, with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, without any appearance of thoſe Strivings and Heats that have too often attended former Elections; and that there might no diſturbance or hinderance happen upon the occaſion of the Soldiers quartering in Cities and Boroughs, they were ordered to draw off, except Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to other Quarters, till the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were over; which was punctually obſerved, with an exact and ready Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and ſoon after his Highneſs put forth a Declaration for the better quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the Forces.</p>
            <p>This Declaration, though the people ſeemed no where unwilling to quarter the Soldiers, according to their ability, highly ſatisfied them in the Prince's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and good Intentions; ſo that the Aſſociation for the preſervation of his Perſon has been promoted, in the Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, through all the Countries of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with much freeneſs and alacrity; a Copy of which, as it was drawn up, and ſigned at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, by the Lords and Gentlemen, take in the following Words.</p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:56844:71"/>
            <q>
               <p>WE whoſe Names are hereunto ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, who have jointed with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for the defence of the Proteſtant Religion, and for maintaining the antient Government, and the Laws and Liberties of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> do engage to Almighty God, to his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and to one another, to ſtick firm to this Cauſe, and to one another in defence of it, and never to depart from it till our Religion, our Laws and Liberties are ſo far ſecured to us in a Free Parliament, that we ſhall be no more in danger of falling under Popery and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: And whereas we are engaged in this common Cauſe under the Protection of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> by which means his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be expoſed to dangers, and to the deſperate and curſed Attempts of the Papiſts and other bloudy Men; we do therefore ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly engage both to God, and to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That if any ſuch Attempts are made upon him, we will purſue not only thoſe that make them, but all their Adherents, and all that we find in Arms againſt us, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſeverities of a juſt Revenge, to their Ruine and final Deſtruction: And that the Execution of any ſuch Attempts (which God of his Mercy forbid) ſhall not divert us from proſecuting this Cauſe which we do now undertake, but that it ſhall engage us to sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56844:72"/>it on with all the vigour that ſo barbarous a Practice ſhall deſerve.</p>
            </q>
            <p>His Highneſs having, as is before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, been pleaſed to take upon him the Adminiſtration of the Civil and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Power, and by reaſon of the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den change and alteration of Affairs the the publick Revenues had been put out of Order, as to the method of Collecting, and placing and diſ-placing the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, he iſſued out a Declaration, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all Collectors, Receivers, and Officers, not being Papiſts, authorized and employed by the proper Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of the Cuſtoms, Exciſe, Hearth-money, or any other Branch of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, to proceed in the Managing, Receiving and Levying the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, as formerly; and that all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Officers ſhould be aſſiſting to them in their reſpective Stations, the better to enable them to make their due Collections and Receipts. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, his Highneſs taking into his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Conſideration the neceſſitous Condition of the poor people, as well Handicrafts as others, deſtitute of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, out of a ſenſe of their wants, cauſed a conſiderable Summe of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to be diſtributed amongſt thoſe of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56844:72"/>the Out-Pariſhes of the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> But now the Papiſts, notwithſtanding a former Declaration, commanding them, not being Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers,, Merchants, or Servants to the Queen Dowager, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to depart the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in contempt of that Declaration, and appearing in great numbers, his Highneſs was pleaſed by another Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, dated the 14th. of <hi>January,</hi> to command them within three days to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the ſaid Cities, and ten miles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, or otherwiſe to be taken, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt, and expect the utmoſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that the Law for their Offences can inflict upon them; commanding all Magiſtrates to make diligent ſearch, and apprehend and impriſon ſuch as ſhould be found in Contempt of the ſaid Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fame of his Highneſs's Succeſs being ſufficiently known in the United Provinces, three Deputies were ſent to congratulate his Succeſs, who landing at the Tower were received with the Diſcharge of the Cannon, and other ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reſpects, as became their Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter; from whence they paſſed to the Lodgings appointed for them, in the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56844:73"/>Coaches ſent to wait upon them, with a ſplendid Equipage.</p>
            <p>His Highneſs had no ſooner ſignified to the City of <hi>London</hi> that the publick Treaſure was in a manner exhauſted, and not ſufficient to defray the neceſſary Expences of the Nation, but a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee was ordered to attend him to know the Summe that might ſupply that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and 100000 <abbr>

               </abbr> being named and proffered to be ſecured, and re-paid, with Intereſt, in ſix Months, a great many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and generous Citizens immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately came to the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and offered their Subſcriptions, which were there accordingly taken, almoſt to admiration; for in a ſhort time, about 300000 <abbr>

               </abbr> was ſubſcribed, and directions being given for the Receivers to attend, it was brought in with ſuch Expedition, that they were forced to encreaſe their number.</p>
            <p>Theſe being the moſt weighty Affairs tranſacted in <hi>England,</hi> let us a while look into thoſe of <hi>Scotland,</hi> our Siſter Kingdom, where we find that upon his Highneſs's Arrival in theſe Parts, the terrour wrought ſo effectually with the Popiſh Miniſters of State, and others, that found themſelves launched beyond

            <q>
               <p>My Lords and Gentlemen,</p>
               <p>THE only Reaſon that enduced me to undergo ſo great an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking was, that I ſaw the Laws and Liberties of theſe Kingdoms overturned, and the Proteſtant
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56844:74"/>Religion in imminent Danger, and ſeeing you are ſo many Noble-men and Gentlemen, I have called you together, that I may have your Advice what is to be done for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Proteſtant Religion, and reſtoring your Laws and Liberties, according to my Declaration.</p>
            </q>
            <p>As ſoon as his Highneſs had retired, the Lords and Gentlemen went to the Council-Chamber at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and there having choſen the Duke of <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> their Preſident, debated what Advice was ſit to be given his Highneſs in that juncture, but came to no Concluſion, farther than to give the Clerks that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Inſtructions to draw up in Writing what they then thought moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 8th. of <hi>January</hi> the Honourable Aſſembly met again, and the Writing was preſented; upon which they debated the moſt expedient way for Convening the general meeting of the Eſtates of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and at laſt agreed in their Opinion, ordering the Writing to be fair drawn over with the Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the 9th. of <hi>January,</hi> they met at Three of the Clock, and the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56844:74"/>Addreſs was prepared, giving his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Thanks for his Pious and Generous Undertaking, for preſerving the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and reſtoring the Laws and Liberties of theſe Kingdoms; deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to take upon him the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Affairs, Civil and Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and diſpoſe of the publick Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and Fortreſſes of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> untill the general Meeting of the States of the Nation, which they humbly prayed his Highneſs to call, to be holden at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the 14th. of <hi>March</hi> next, and to iſſue out his Letters for the calling them, being Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Theſe being the Heads and Subſtance of this Addreſs, it was ſubſcribed by 30 Lords, and about 80 Gentlemen, and was preſented to his Highneſs in their preſence, by the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, who thanked them for the Truſt they repoſed in him, and deſired a time to conſider upon ſo wheighty an Affair: When the next day his Highneſs again met the Scotch Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and made them the following Speech.</p>
            <pb n="140" facs="tcp:56844:75"/>
            <q>
               <p>My Lords and Gentlemen,</p>
               <p>IN purſuance of your Advice, I will, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Meeting of the Eſtates in <hi>March</hi> next, give ſuch Orders concerning the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as are neceſſary for the Calling the ſaid Meeting, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Peace, the applying of the publick Revenue to the moſt preſſing uſes, and putting the Fortreſſes into the Hands of Perſons in whom the Nation can have a juſt Confidence; and I do farther aſſure you, that you will always find me ready to concurr with you in every thing, that may be found neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the ſecuring the Proteſtant Religion, and reſtoring the Laws and Liberties of the Nation.</p>
            </q>
            <p>By this time the Earl of <hi>Crauford,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Louthian,</hi> and others, being come to Town, the former of theſe Earls deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Highneſs that they might ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Addreſs, which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly granted, his Highneſs leaving ſignal marks of a high ſatisfaction in the Countenances of the noble Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, which demonſtrated how much they were pleaſed with his Anſwer; nor no ſooner did the News arrive at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:56844:75"/>but it was received with the ringing of Bells, loud Shouts, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of Joy, and in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſwiftly overſpread that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh Soldiers many of them having been impoſed upon by ill affected Perſons to doubt their Pay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his Highneſs was pleaſed to put forth a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſurance, that he had taken care for the ſatisfying and making good to every Officer, and Soldier, their full Pay and Arrears, due to them untill the firſt day of <hi>January,</hi> 1688. and for the making conſtant and punctual payment of Subſiſtence Money, and clearing of the Army in the uſual method, without any the leaſt diminution of their former Pay, ordering all Officers to repair to their reſpective Commands, and Soldiers to their Quarters and Rendezvouz, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch penalties as a refuſal may incur; and that nothing might be wanting on his part, His Highneſs in another Paper gave the like notice and aſſurance to the Sea-men belonging to the Engliſh Fleet, under the Command of the Lord <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi> And now the Royal African Company intreated his Highneſs to doe them the Honour of taking upon him to be their Governour for the enſuing year,

            <p>Thurſday <hi>the</hi> 31ſt. <hi>of</hi> January <hi>inſtant, being appointed for the City of</hi> London, <hi>and Ten Miles diſtance, and</hi> Thurſday <hi>the 14th. day of</hi> February <hi>following for the reſt of the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus all things concurring towards a happy Settlement, and Uniting of Proteſtants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> let us look a little into the Affairs of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which as yet has not the like proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, as being very much inhabited by Native Iriſh Papiſts, devoted Enemies to the Proteſtant Religion. The Earl of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56844:78"/>
               <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> whom the King had made his Lieutenant, or Deputy of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, taking the advantage of the hurry and diſorder the Affairs of <hi>England</hi> had put the People into, magnified their Fears, and uſed his endeavours to gain them to a Revolt, but finding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in no wiſe forward to joyn or take part with him, he inſtantly ſent his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters through all the Provinces and Countries, to cauſe the Gentry and Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants to take up Arms on the behalf of the King, and the defence of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, declaring, if the King himſelf ſhould in that juncture deſire it, he would not deliver up his Sword; ſo that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no endeavours to ſtrengthen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf untried, he in a ſhort time drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a formidable Army, and ſecured divers Places of ſtrength, fortifying the Houſes and Caſtles of ſeveral Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; whereupon, it was thought fit to ſend to him, and know his Intentions; but no farther ſatisfaction, at that time, could be gained, than that he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſtand for the King's Intereſt, and expect his Commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly upon notice that he, upon his a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time withdrawing himſelf, was in <hi>France,</hi> the Report went currant, that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56844:79"/>he ſent thither to know his Pleaſure; in the mean while, though he offered no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Hoſtilities to the Proteſtants, yet in many Places he oppreſſed them by Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his Soldiers at diſcretion in their Houſes, ſeizing their Arms, and taking Hoſtages.</p>
            <p>His Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> having taken upon him, at the requeſt of the Lords and Commons, the farther Adminiſtration of Government in Civil and Military Affairs, proceeded to the moſt effectual meanes for the better ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Army, and taking care for their Payment; and the better to aſſure them, and encourage men of worth and true Valour, the ſale of Offices, or Military Employments are laid aſide.</p>
            <p>And now the Wiſdom of the Nation having thought it, as we head, neceſſary to have the preſence of her Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> upon this great juncture of Affairs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a Convoy of Men of War, as well Engliſh as Dutch, was ordered to wait upon her till her Equipage could be got in a readineſs and the Wind ſerved to bring over her Highneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the Joy of the People, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation or the Arrival of her Royal
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56844:79"/>Highneſs, and the preparations for her Reception, we had News from <hi>France</hi> that the King and Queen of <hi>England</hi> were frequently viſited by the French Nobility, and entertained with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Grandeur; and that the French King gave out that he would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Forces in the Field, early in the Spring, to oppoſe the gathering Armies of the Confederate Princes, and States of <hi>Holland,</hi> promiſing to himſelf thoſe advantages which only Time can make out, or determine: In oppoſition to which, and to diſable him in the leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Revenues, an Addreſs was agreed on by the honourable Convention, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> upon the great emergency of Affairs, to deſire and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to iſſue out his Proclamation for the prohibiting the Importation of French Commodities, and the going out of any Ships hence for <hi>France,</hi> farther recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the State of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condition requires, to his Care.

            <p>And becauſe the ſixth of <hi>February</hi> was at hand, to prevent the Thankſgiving formerly appointed to be held on that day, an Order of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, bearing date the ſecond of the ſame Month, was made publick in theſe words:</p>

            <p>Theſe being received, and many weighty Conſiderations urging it, her Royal Highneſs's Coming over was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened, and being on her Departure for <hi>England,</hi> the States General, the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> the Council of State, the Courts of Juſtice, and all other Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, either in Body, or by their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, made their Complements to her on the Occaſion; and the like was done by foreign Miniſters, and all other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56844:81"/>of Quality; and at her Leaving the <hi>Hague,</hi> the Magiſtrates entreated that the Burghers might attend her in Arms; but She excuſed it; however the States of <hi>Holland</hi> appointed three of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to wait upon her Royal Highneſs to the place of her Embarquing; ſending Orders to the <hi>Sieur d' Allemonde,</hi> and the Ships under his Command, to joyn Admiral <hi>Herbert,</hi> who from <hi>England</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her with a Squadron of Men of war, and ſundry Yatches, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conveniency of Tranſportation; and having a proſperous Gale, on the 12th. of <hi>February,</hi> in the afternoon She ſafely arrived at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> having been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by the Guns of the Forts, Ships in the road and thoſe of the <hi>Tower,</hi> where the Royal Banner was diſplayed, and by that Example the Ships likewiſe had put out their Flags and Streamers.</p>

            <p>The Pomp of the Solemnity being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and night coming on, the Bells and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56844:83"/>Bonfires made a ſecond Proclamation of the Peoples Satisfaction, and the news, by the Thundering of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, was in a ſhort time carried, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the fire of the Guns from one Ship to another, beyond the Iſland it ſelf; nor were their curious Fire-works and Devices wanting on this Occaſion; and the Solemnity was more eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with Magnificent Entertainments at Court; and ſoon after their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, with the like Demonſtration of Joy, were Proclaimed in all the Cities and Principal Burghs, Towns of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 15th. of <hi>February</hi> His Majeſty returned both Houſes a very Gracious Anſwer to their Declaration, wherein he expreſſed Himſelf highly ſatisfied with what they had done, and was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to promiſed them the utmoſt of his Care and Protection, for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Religion, Laws, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties: and that He would be willing to concurr with them in any thing that ſhould be for the Good of the Kingdom, and to doe all that in him lay to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Glory and Welfare of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>About this time a Complaint was
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56844:84"/>made, that divers diſorderly Perſons, notwithſtanding a former Declaration, ſtrictly enjoyning the contrary, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to deſtroy the Deer, Timber, and Underwoods, in divers Chaſes and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts.

            <p>On the 18th. of <hi>February</hi> in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the King went from <hi>White-Hall,</hi> in his Barge of State to the Parliament-Stairs, where he was received by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the great Officers, and others, the Yeomen of the Guards, and Gentlemen Pentioners, making a Lane from the Water-ſide to the Door going up into the Prince's Lodgings; the Proceedings being in this manner: Firſt went the Officers at Arms, then the Noble-men, bearing white Staves, and after them Serjeants at Arms, the <hi>Garter</hi> King at Arms between two Gentlemen-Uſhers, immediately before the Sword of State, which was born by the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> having on the Left hand the Duke of

               <hi>Norfolk,</hi> Earl Marſhal of <hi>England,</hi> with his Marſhal's Staff, next went the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> bearing the Cup of State, then the King, followed by an Officer of the Guards, and other Perſons of Quality, the Gentlemen Pentioners cloſing the Rear; and his Majeſty being come into the Prince's Lodging, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with his Sur-coat and Mantle of Crimſon Velvet, bordered with Gold-Lace, and furred with Ermins, as alſo with the Collar of the Order of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and as ſoon as the Crown was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon His Head, the Officers at Arms, and the Serjeants at Arms ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Houſe of Lords, and the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who preceded his Majeſty, having placed themſelves on each ſide of the Throne, and his Majeſty, whoſe Train was born up by Noble-mens Eldeſt Sons, being-ſeated on the Throne, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman Uſher of the Black Rod was commanded to ſummon up the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, who being accordingly introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the Houſe of Peers, and their Speaker conducted to the Bar, with the uſual Formalities, and the Lords being in their Robes, His Majeſty made a moſt Gracious ſpeech, in which he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to let them know how ſenſible he
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56844:85"/>was of their Kindneſs, and how much he valued the confidence they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in him; Aſſuring them that he would never do any thing that might leſſen their good Opinion of him, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in mind of the Allies abroad, and the hazard they may run, eſpecially <hi>Holland,</hi> unleſs ſome ſpeedy Care were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: That a good Settlement was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary at Home; particularly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending to them the dangerous State of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Methods to their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conſideration.</p>
            <p>On the 2d. of <hi>February</hi> the Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop on <hi>London,</hi> with the Clergy of the City, to the number of an 100 waited on their Majeſties with an humble Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Fidelity and Duty, and being Graciouſly received, were admitted to kiſs their Majeſties Hands, the King at the ſame time being pleaſed to give them a full Aſſurance of of his great Affection to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of all the Protection and Encouragement to them, for which he gave them his Royal Word; concluding with Aſſuring them, that they ſhould ever find it ſo, and they might depend upon it, the Houſes reſolved into a free Parliament. His Majeſty went on the 23d. of <hi>February</hi> by Water to the Houſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56844:86"/>of Lords, attended with the uſual Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and being in his Royal Robes, with the Crown on his Head, ſeated on the Throne, and the Commons being ſent for, His Majeſty gave the Royal Aſſent to an Act, <hi>for removing and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting all Queſtions and Disputes about the Aſſembling and Sitting of the preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi> And having diſrobed himſelf, he was attended to the Water-ſide with the like Ceremony as before, and in the afternoon their Majeſties went to <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>-Court.</p>
            <p>On the 28th. of <hi>February</hi> two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations were iſſued forth by the King and Queen, the one at the Requeſt of the Honourable Houſe of Commons to apprehend <hi>Robert Brent,</hi> Gentleman, late of the Inner-<hi>Temple,</hi> charged with High Treaſon, who procuring himſelf to be Bailed had left them, and fled from Juſtice, with the Reward of 200 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> to any perſon that ſhould diſcover or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, and thoſe that ſhould conceal, or further his Eſcape, to be proceeded againſt with the utmoſt ſeverity accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law.</p>
            <p>The other for the bringing in and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of Arms that had been Embezled, or Loſt, during the Diſorders and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandings
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56844:86"/>amongſt the Soldiers, that had been in pay under the late King <hi>James;</hi> and upon advice that the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> laboured to draw the <hi>Iriſh</hi> more and more to his Party, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm thoſe that were already in Arms with him, by laying before them the Danger already incurr'd, their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, to leave them that ſhould obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſiſt, without excuſe, iſſued forth a Proclamation, offering amongſt other things Pardon and Indemnity for all things, by thoſe of the Earl's Party, if they laid down their Arms, and retired themſelves to their reſpective Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Places of Abode, and there pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably behaved themſelves as good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ought to doe; as likewiſe that they ſhould upon this (ondition enjoy in full freedom their Eſtates according to Law, and thoſe of the Roman Church, upon ſuch Conſideration to have all the Favour, for the private Exerciſe of their Religion that the Law allows, with a promiſe ſpeedily to call a Parliament in that Kingdom; but on the Contrary declaring them Rebels, and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their Lands and Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons forfeited, and to be diſpoſed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed to thoſe that ſhould be Aiding,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56844:87"/>and Aſſiſting in reducing the Kingdom to its due Obedience.</p>
            <p>This Proclamation 'tis thought, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hindred by <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s violence from coming to the knowledge of the Vulgar, or creating a fear in his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, made him fly to his Laſt refuge of more ſtrictly diſarming the Proteſtants, as well thoſe in Cities that fell into his hands, as Gentlemen who were retired to their Houſes, where his Soldiers committed ſundry Outrages of an high Nature, Robbing and Pillaging with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remorſe or pity, though under a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour excuſed himſelf, by giving dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the Magiſtrates to ſee that no wrong ſhould be done; however when Complaints were made, he urged neceſſity compell'd his Men to doe what they did; yet the Proteſtants, eſpecially in the North, ſtood to their Arms, and repelled force by force, getting ſome ſupplies of Ammunition out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> keeping the Town of <hi>Sligo,</hi> and other places of ſtrength, with a Longing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Arrival of the Forces and neceſſary Proviſions from <hi>England,</hi> to be thereby enable to carry on the War, and recover what has been taken from them by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts.</p>
            <pb n="165" facs="tcp:56844:87"/>
            <p>And now the duty of Hearth mony being looked upon by the Commons, as a grievance to the Subjects, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as ſuch to his Majeſty, the King was pleaſed to ſend a meſſage that he left it to their conſiderations, either to regulate it, or to take it away, which was received with great ſatisfaction, and forthwith the thanks of the Houſe were ordered to be returned his Majeſty for his gracious Meſſage; and on the 1ſt. of <hi>March</hi> in the Afternoon, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament aſſembled, Waited upon his Majeſty in the Banqueting-houſe and and there preſented an Addreſs of thanks, wherein they expreſſed the Joy and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction they conceived at ſo unpreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented an offer, humbly craving leave to preſent their Aſſurance, that they-would make ſuch gratefull and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate returns, as were ſuitable to his Majeſties moſt Gracious Intentions, and be ſo carefull of the Support of the Crown that the World ſhould ſee, to the diſcouraging his Enemies, that his Majeſty reigns in the Hearts of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons Aſſembled in Parliament,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56844:88"/>made likewiſe and Addreſs to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, expreſſing therein how highly they were ſenſible of their great and Signal deliverance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that being fully convinced of the reſtleſs Spirits, and continued Endeavours of his Majeſties and the Nations Enemies, for the Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Subverſion of the Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they unanimouſly declared, that they would Stand by, and Aſſiſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with their Lives and Fortunes, in Supporting his Allies abroad, in redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in defence of the Proteſtant Religion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>To this his Majeſty was pleaſed to return them a very Gracious Anſwer, expreſſing therein the valuable Eſteem he had for Parliaments, and eſpecially for this, expreſſing his Satisfaction of the Confidence and Truſt they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in him, and that it ſhould be his Care never to give any Parliament cauſe of diſtruſt; and withall recommending to them the care of the Allies abroad, and minding them of the greate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the States of <hi>Holland</hi> had been at in the Expedition and Zeal they had to promote it, and to ſecond his Majeſties
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56844:88"/>Endeavours even with a neglect of their own Safety, not doubting but their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity would not only enable him to make good his treaty with thoſe States, and repay what they actually layd out, and of which an account ſhould be given, but ſupport them to their utmoſt Ability againſt the power of their Enemies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering both Intereſts were upon one and the ſame Bottom. As to ſafety, his Majeſty was likewiſe pleaſed to mind them of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to let them know, that in his opinion 20000 men would be required to render the reducing it ſhort and eaſie, as likewiſe ſetting out a Fleet which in conjunction with that of <hi>Holland,</hi> might be ſo entirely Maſter of the Seas that nothing might be ſent from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Ireland,</hi> or elſewhere, that might give a diſturbance to us or our Allies; farther recommending to their conſideration the ſettlement of the Revenues, that they might be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected without diſpute; promiſing that whatever ſhould be given in order to publick ends, ſhould be ſtrictly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, with many other Gracious expreſſions; concluding that as they ſo freely offered to hazard all that is dear to them, ſo he would as freely expoſe
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56844:89"/>his Life for the Support of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and the Honour and Safety of the Nation.</p>
            <p>And now the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of <hi>London,</hi> in Common Council aſſembled as a grateful Acknowledgment to the Lords and Commons for their excellent Conducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Affairs, and eſpecially their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to aſſiſt and ſtand by his Majeſty in ſupporting his Allies abroad, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing <hi>Ireland,</hi> in defence of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, drew up two humble Addreſſes of Thanks, one to the Lords, and the other to the Commons, which were preſented and very kindly received; the firſt of theſe was preſented by the Recorder, and the laſt by the Sheriffs of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable City, who were diſmiſſed with expreſſions of high Eſteem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the ſaid City an Addreſs of Thanks was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe preſented to his Majeſty by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council, upon his moſt condeſcending and unparallell'd Goodneſs in the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage he was pleaſed to ſend to the two Houſes, in relation to the Duty of Hearth-mony, promiſing as bound in duty and great obligations, to be ready
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56844:89"/>to ſerve and aſſiſt his Majeſty as far as they were able in the ſupport of his Crown and Dignity, and for the maintaining the Proteſtant Religion and Laws of the Land, and the ſpeedy relief of the diſtreſſed Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>About this time we had News that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the Regiment of Foot, late com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Lord <hi>Dumbarton,</hi> and ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Fuziliers, made a Mutiny near <hi>Ipſwych,</hi> and ſeized on the Money ſent down to pay them, with four Field-pieces, and refuſing to obey the King's Orders, marched away, doing great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and bringing a greater terrour upon the Country people, proclaiming King <hi>James,</hi> &amp;c. whereupon both houſes Addreſſed his Majeſty that he would be pleaſed to take ſuch effectual Courſe, as in his Princely Wiſdom ſhould be thought fit for the ſuppreſſing and bringing them to Juſtice; and that in the mean time he would iſſue out his Royal Proclamation, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them and their Adherents to be Rebels and Traitors, requiring all good Subjects to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſubdue and proſecute them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which His Majeſty was pleaſed to anſwer, That he thanked both Houſes for their Addreſs, and that he had ſent a Force of Horſe and Dragoons ſufficient to ſuppreſs them, and that he would iſſue out a Proclamation, as was deſired.</p>
            <p>On the 16th of <hi>March</hi> His Majeſty went by water to the Houſe of Lords, attended with the uſual Solemnity, and being in his Royal Robes, ſeated on the Throne, and the Commons ſent for up, His Majeſty gave the Royal Aſſent to an Act impowering him to apprehend ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as he ſhould find juſt cauſe to ſuſpect are
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56844:90"/>conſpiring againſt the Government, and to an Act for annulling and making void the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>William Ruſſel</hi> Eſquire, commonly called Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and then in a gracious Speech, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things, recommended to them the ſettling the Oaths, to be taken by all perſons to be admitted to places of Truſt; ſo that Papiſts might be excluded, and room left for all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants that are willing to ſerve, the better to ſtrengthen us againſt the common Adverſaries; and the ſame day a Proclamation was ſigned by His Majeſty, declaring thoſe mutinous Officers and Soldiers, together with their Adherents, Rebels and Traitors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> commanding all good Subjects to apprehend, ſubdue and proſecute them as ſuch.</p>
            <p>To ſhew this was no general defection of the Soldiers, but rather theſe few drawn into ſo great a folly and over-ſight by ſiniſter means, the ſame day an Addreſs was humbly preſented to His Majeſty, ſigned by the Officers ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and ſubordinate, with the unanimous Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of the private Soldiers of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Foot under the conduct of the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Mordant,</hi> expreſſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their unfeigned Loyalty, willing Obedience, and ready Zeal to ſerve his Majeſty in all places and on all occaſions. Nor was it long e'er thoſe in Rebellion were brought under; for on the 19th of <hi>March</hi> the Regiments of Horſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Sir <hi>John Lanier,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> having joined the Dutch Troups of Horſe and Dragoons, under the command of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General <hi>Ginkell,</hi> and being informed that the Rebels were marching towards <hi>Seaford,</hi> they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56844:90"/>advanced in good Order, the Dragoons, making the left Wing; the Rebels no ſooner perceived the Troups, but they drew up in Batalia, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their four Field-pieces to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, having on one ſide a great Hedge, and on the other conſiderable Waters, which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Dragoons to ſwim; but perceiving the Reſolution of the King's Troups to reduce them to their Obedience, they beat a Parly, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down their Arms, ſurrendred upon diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that there were taken the four Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces, and twenty Officers, and five hundred Soldiers were made Priſoners, and ſent up to <hi>London,</hi> under a Guard of Horſe, and there ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in divers Priſons, whilſt another party of Horſe continued to ſearch after ſuch as had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, ſome of which were afterward taken, and ſecured in divers Priſons.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Chapman,</hi> Lord Mayor of the City of <hi>London,</hi> dying on the of <hi>March,</hi> the worthy <hi>Thomas Pilkington</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Having before made mention of the intended Convention in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and now the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for its ſitting being come, it will not

            <p>On the 14th of <hi>March,</hi> in obedience to the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Letter, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons aſſembled at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in one Houſe, as the Cuſtome is, and choſe Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> their Preſident, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Duke of <hi>Gourdon,</hi> a Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, held the Caſtle, whoſe Cannon commanded the City, they made an Act, by which they empowered the Earls of <hi>Lothain</hi> and <hi>Tweddale</hi> to repair immediately to the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and to require him and others of his perſuaſion there, in the Name of the Eſtates of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to remove out of that Caſtle in twenty four hours after notice given, and to leave the Charge thereof to the next commanding Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, being a Proteſtant, and that he, and thoſe that were with him, upon ſuch a compliance, ſhould have aſſurance from the Eſtates, to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and indempnified as to any thing they had acted in that or any other Station, contrary to Law, as being Papiſts.</p>
            <p>This done, they nominated a Committee of Election conſiſting of 15 perſons, five of each Eſtate, and after ſome debate, whether the Lords Spiritual were a diſtinct Eſtate, or only a part of the ſame Eſtate with the Lords Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, which was laid aſide by the Houſe, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Negative, and rejecting the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations againſt the ſitting of the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> before his Father's Attainder was taken off. A Motion was made, that in conſideration the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was full of People, and many of them armed,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56844:91"/>to prevent diſorders, it was not inconvenient to command all perſons, who were not Inhabitants, nor immediately belonging to the Members of this Convention, to depart the place, but it was the Opinion of the Houſe, that the Caſtle, in the command of whoſe Cannon the City was, ought to be firſt ſurrendered, and for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſurance, a Committee was ordered to take care that no violation of the Peace were made. And the next day the Duke of <hi>Gourdon</hi> having ſent a Paper by way of Excuſe, for holding the Caſtle contrary to the mind of the Eſtates, it was read, and advantageous Terms offered him, and thoſe with him, in conſideration of a ſpeedy Surrender; but ſoon after he diſcovered his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was only to trifle, that he might gain time, which obliged them to ſend for ſuch a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent number of armed Men, as was capable to block it up, and prevent the Excurſions of the Beſieged; ſo that ſmall bickerings frequently happened, though without any conſiderable da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. In the mean while two Letters came to the Convention, one from King <hi>William,</hi> and the other from the late King, of which only the firſt was approved, and the Convention procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take meaſures much like thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> declaring the Throne vacant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration in order to fill it, ſuffering Men and Arms from <hi>England</hi> to enter that Kingdom, and it was in fine concluded, that King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould be crowned King and Queen of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Crown of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them with an Inſtrument of Government to ſettle and regulate particulars.</p>
